Hypertensive symptoms in the vertebro-basilar system predominated in the under 45 age group, while for the over 45 patients and those suffering for more than 5 years, hypertensive symptoms were likewise noted in the internal carotid arterial system. Signs of angiospasm were revealed both for patients with cervical osteochondrosis and without it. Hypertensive signs were noted in 88.5% of patients with Meniere's disease and as a rule they were noted in the entire vertebro-basilar system without respect to the presence or absence of concurrent cervical osteochondrosis and uni- or bilateral affection of the labyrinth; in patients over 45 who had suffered more than 5 years this also applied to the internal carotid arterial system.

19810008222,MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT,Development and fabrication of an advanced liquid cooling garment,"A tube/fin concept liquid cooling garment head cooler was developed, fabricated and delivered to NASA-ARC. The head cooler was fabricated from polyurethane film which sandwiches the transport fluid tubing and a thermally conductive fin material. The head cooler garment is sewn to form a skull cap and covered with a comfort liner.

No improvement was found farther downstream with or without the orifice plate. Various windmills were studied to determine their effects on the downstream flow pattern. The windmill retarded flow velocity inside the circle inscribed by the tip of free wheeling propellers (used as substitute windmills), while the main stream passed over the blades seemingly unrestricted and without showing any increase in diameter. Results show that by varying a torque, the flow across a windmill can be effectively redistributed, an effect that could be gainfully employed in situations where the main flow into a diffuser is concentrated near the center. The construction of the 1/24 scale model tunnel and the velocity transverses obtained on the model are discussed.

This cell construction has several potential advantages over conventional cells for space use namely, convenience of interconnects, lower operating temperatures and higher efficiency due to the elimination of grid shadowing. However, the processing is more complex, and the cell is inherently more radiation sensitive. The latter problem can be reduced substantially by making the cells very thin (approximately 50 micrometers). Two types of interdigitated back contact cells are possible, the types being dependent on the character of the front surface. The front surface field cell has a front surface region that is of the same conductivity type as the bulk but is more heavily doped. This creates an electric field at the surface which repels the minority carriers. The tandem junction cell has a front surface region of a conductivity type that is opposite to that of the bulk. The junction thus created floats to open circuit voltage on illumination and injects carriers into the bulk which then can be collected at the rear junction. For space use, the front surface field cell is potentially more radiation resistant than the tandem junction cell because the flow of minority carriers (electrons) into the bulk will be less sensitive to the production of recombination centers, particularly in the space charge region at the front surface.",2013-09-04,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810009970/downloads/19810009970.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Another sample, fabricated with, at most, slight modifications did not perform nearly as well. In all samples, attempts to improve self subtraction characteristics by various thermal treatments had no effects or adverse effects, with one exception in which improvement was noted after a time delay of several days. A theory developed to describe self subtraction showed the observed decrease in beam intensity with time, but the shape of the predicted decay curve was oscillatory in contrast to the exponential like decay observed. The theory was also inadequate to account for the experimental sensitivity of self subtraction to the Bragg angle of the hologram. It is concluded that self subtraction is a viable method for optical processing systems requiring background discrimination.",2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19810010904/downloads/19810010904.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19810010914,LASERS AND MASERS,Test techniques for determining laser ranging system performance,Procedures and results of an on going test program intended to evaluate laser ranging system performance levels in the field as well as in the laboratory are summarized. Tests show that laser ranging system design requires consideration of time biases and RMS jitters of individual system components. All simple Q switched lasers tested were found to be inadequate for 10 centimeter ranging systems. Timing discriminators operating over a typical 100:1 dynamic signal range may introduce as much as 7 to 9 centimeters of range bias. Time interval units commercially available today are capable of half centimeter performance and are adequate for all field systems currently deployed. Photomultipliers tested show typical tube time biases of one centimeter with single photoelectron transit time jitter of approximately 10 centimeters.

This model has two coefficients of interest for interpretation phi(1) and theta(1).

(2) The phi(1) coefficient increases with decreasing pixel size and increasing topographic complexity. (3) Changes in topography have a greater influence upon phi(1) than changes in land cover class. (4) The theta(1) seems to vary with the amount of atmospheric haze.

It is assumed that pulsar gamma-rays are produced by curvature radiation from relativistic particles above the polar cap and attenuated by pair production in the strong magnetic and electric fields. Assuming that all pulsars produce gamma-rays in this way, their luminosities can be predicted as a function of period and magnetic field strength. Using the distribution of pulsars in the galaxy as determined from data on 328 pulsars detected in three surveys, the local gamma-ray production spectrum, the longitude profile, and the latitude profile of pulsar gamma-ray flux are calculated. The largest sources of uncertainty in the size of the pulsar contribution are the value of the mean interstellar electron density, the turnover in the pulsar radio luminosity function, and the average pulsar magnetic field strength. A present estimate is that pulsars contribute from 15 to 20 % of the total flux of gamma-rays from the galactic plane.",2013-09-04,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810011471/downloads/19810011471.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
