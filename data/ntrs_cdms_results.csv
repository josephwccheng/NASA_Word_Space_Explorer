The nominal baseband processor throughput is one million packets per second (1.6 Gb/s) from one thousand T1 carrier rate customer premises terminals. A frequency reuse factor of sixteen is assumed by using 16 spot antenna beams with the same 100 MHz bandwidth per beam and a modulation with a one b/s per Hz bandwidth efficiency. Eight of the beams are fixed on major metropolitan areas and eight are scanning beams which periodically cover the remainder of the U.S. under dynamic control. User signals are regenerated (demodulated/remodulated) and message packages are reformatted on board. Frequency division multiple access and time division multiplex are employed on the uplinks and downlinks, respectively, for terminals within the coverage area and dwell interval of a scanning beam.

19810002948,ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONVERSION,Satellite power system salvage and disposal alternatives,"A wide range of salvage options for the SPS satellite, ranging from use in and beyond geosynchronous orbit to use in low Earth orbit in return and use on Earth are presented. The satellite can be used intact to provide power for various purposes, it can be cannibalized or it can be melted down to supply materials for space or ground based products. The use of SPS beyond its nominal lifetime provides value that can be deducted from the SPS capital investment cost. The present value of the salvage value of the SPS satellites, referenced to the system initial operation data, is on the order of five to ten percent of its on-orbit capital cost. (Given a 30 year satellite lifetime and a four percent discount rate, the theoretical maximum salvage value is 30.8 percent of the capital cost.) The SPS demonstration satellite is available some 30 years earlier than the first full scale SPS satellite and has a salvage value on the order of 80 percent of its on-orbit capital cost. In the event that it becomes desirable to dispose of either the demonstration of full scale SPS satellite, a number of disposal options is presented for which intact disposal costs are less than one percent of capital costs.",2013-09-04,1980-11-01,/api/citations/19810002948/downloads/19810002948.pdf,/api/citations/19810002948/downloads/19810002948.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19810003086,GEOPHYSICS,Feasibility of quasi-random band model in evaluating atmospheric radiance,"The use of the quasi-random band model in evaluating upwelling atmospheric radiation is investigated. The spectral transmittance and total band adsorptance are evaluated for selected molecular bands by using the line by line model, quasi-random band model, exponential sum fit method, and empirical correlations, and these are compared with the available experimental results. The atmospheric transmittance and upwelling radiance were calculated by using the line by line and quasi random band models and were compared with the results of an existing program called LOWTRAN. The results obtained by the exponential sum fit and empirical relations were not in good agreement with experimental results and their use cannot be justified for atmospheric studies. The line by line model was found to be the best model for atmospheric applications, but it is not practical because of high computational costs. The results of the quasi random band model compare well with the line by line and experimental results. The use of the quasi random band model is recommended for evaluation of the atmospheric radiation.",2013-09-04,1980-08-01,/api/citations/19810003086/downloads/19810003086.pdf,/api/citations/19810003086/downloads/19810003086.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Multiple embedded 8086 and 2901 microprocessors, supported by dedicated hardware modules, perform the required real time operations for both transmit and receive functions. Commands from a host computer determine the configuration of the WBSCU via the IEEE 488 bus. Each of the four WBSCU channels is assigned to process a specified IF waveform; each channel configures its own resources and, in some cases, borrows resources from other channels. The processed waveform data is communicated from individual channels to redundant global memories. Data flow between the user community and global memories occurs via redundant 1553 buses through intelligent Bus Interface Units. Each WBSCU channel contains one 2901 bit slice machine and one 8086 microprocessor. The 2901 provides high speed processing capability for the most time critical operations. The 8086 is used for lower speed processing tasks where its high level language capability can be better exploited.

19810003484,INORGANIC AND PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY,Photochemistry of monodentate and bidentate carbonato complexes of rhodium (3),"A scheme for the photochemical fixation of water is proposed which involves a five-step reaction sequence; the first step involves the 2 electron reduction of a metal by a coordinated carbonate ligand, with corresponding oxidation of the carbonate to CO2 and O2. Ligand field photolysis of trans- (RH(en)2 H2O CO3) ClO4, and (Rh(en)2 CO3) CLO4 have been studied in the solid state and in aqueous solution at various pH values. Both salts are photoinert in the solid phase, but are quite photoreactive in aqueous solution. In solution, the monodentate ion undergoes efficient isomerization to a mixture of cis and trans - (Rh(en)2 H2O CO3)+, presumably with water exchange. A minor pH increase upon photolysis is evidence of inefficient carbonate (CO3 =) release, with formation of (Rh(en)2 (H2O)2)3+. In contrast, aqueous solutions of the bidentate carbonato complex undergo efficient pH decrease upon ligand field photolysis. Changes in the electronic spectrum (200-500 nm) and pH changes indicate that the desired redox is occurring.

Because of such a short range, the thickness information is contained in the very few lowest spectral components of the output signal. To overcome this inconvenience, the Fourier series of the output signal was augmented to approximate a Fourier integral.

The advanced takeoff procedures developed involved violating some of the current Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), but it was not necessary to violate any FAR noise-test conditions during landing approach. Noise contours were also determined for some of the simulated takeoffs and landings in order to indicate the noise-reduction advantages of using operational procedures other than standard.",2013-09-04,1980-11-01,/api/citations/19810003535/downloads/19810003535.pdf,/api/citations/19810003535/downloads/19810003535.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The requirements for adaptive control indicate that a dynamic model should be identified from data sampled during engine operation. The dynamic model identified was of the form of linear differential equations with time varying coefficients. A turbine engine is, however, a highly nonlinear system, so the identified model would be valid only over a small area near the operating point, thus requiring frequent updating of the coefficients in the model. Therefore it is necessary that the identifier use only recent information to perform its function. The identifier selected minimized the square of the equation errors. Known linear systems were used to test the characteristics of the identifier. It was found that the performance was dependent on the number of data points used in the computations and upon the time interval over which the data points were obtained. Preliminary results using an engine deck for the quiet, clean, shorthaul experimental engine indicate that the identified model predicts the engine motion well when there is sufficient dynamic information, that is when the engine is in transient operation.",2013-08-11,1980-10-01,/api/citations/19810003590/downloads/19810003590.pdf,/api/citations/19810003590/downloads/19810003590.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19810003580

The piloting task was to use the electronic attitude direction indicator (EADI) to capture and maintain a 3  degree glide slope in the presence of wind shear and to complete the landing using the perspective runway included on the EADI. The decoupled control system used constant prefilter and feedback gains to provide steady state decoupling of flight path angle, pitch angle, and forward velocity. The decoupled control system improved the pilots' ability to control airspeed and flight path angle during the final stages of an approach made in severe wind shear. The system also improved their ability to complete safe landings. The pilots preferred the decoupled control system in severe winds and, on a pilot rating scale, rated the approach and landing task with the decoupled control system as much as 3 to 4 increments better than use of the VCWS system.",2013-09-04,1980-11-01,/api/citations/19810003599/downloads/19810003599.pdf,/api/citations/19810003599/downloads/19810003599.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A general procedure is developed, and several illustrative examples are included. Emphasis is placed not only on the synthesis of the design, but on the assessment of the results as well. The first step is to establish the differences, distinguishing characteristics and connections between the modern and classical control theory approaches. Ultimately, this uncovers a relationship between bandwidth goals familiar in classical control and cost function weights in the equivalent optimal system. In order to obtain a practical optimal solution, it is also necessary to formulate the problem very carefully, and each choice of state, measurement and output variable must be judiciously considered. Once design goals are established and problem formulation completed, the control system is synthesized in a straightforward manner. Three steps are involved: filter-observer solution, regulator solution, and the combination of those two into the controller.

Both of these subjects can be identified by remote sensing methods more reliably than individual outcrops, which are small and occur in a wide variety of environments with a wide range of responses. Bedrock outcrops themselves could not be resolved by any of the data sources used, nor did any combination of data sources specifically identify rock at the ground surface. The data sources could not simply be combined mathematically to produce a visual image of probable areas of near surface bedrock.

Since the amount and distribution of precipitation were adequate during the 1977 and 1978 growing seasons, no significant stress occurred. Crop conditions were very favorable. As a result, crop signatures were too uniform to reflect soilscape variations and crop condition changes. In 1979 precipitation was again adequate to excess, particularly in June and August.

19810013482,AERONAUTICS (GENERAL),A rapid perturbation procedure for determining nonlinear flow solutions:  Application to transonic turbomachinery flows,"Perturbation procedures and associated computational codes for determining nonlinear flow solutions were developed to establish a method for minimizing computational requirements associated with parametric studies of transonic flows in turbomachines. The procedure that was developed and evaluated was found to be capable of determining highly accurate approximations to families of strongly nonlinear solutions which are either continuous or discontinuous, and which represent variations in some arbitrary parameter. Coordinate straining is employed to account for the movement of discontinuities and maxima of high gradient regions due to the perturbation. The development and results reported are for the single parameter perturbation problem. Flows past both isolated airfoils and compressor cascades involving a wide variety of flow and geometry parameter changes are reported. Attention is focused in particular on transonic flows which are strongly supercritical and exhibit large surface shock movement over the parametric range studied; and on subsonic flows which display large pressure variations in the stagnation and peak suction pressure regions. Comparisons with the corresponding 'exact' nonlinear solutions indicate a remarkable accuracy and range of validity of such a procedure.",2013-09-04,1981-05-01,/api/citations/19810013482/downloads/19810013482.pdf,/api/citations/19810013482/downloads/19810013482.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810013786,FLUID MECHANICS AND HEAT TRANSFER,Combustion of solid carbon rods in zero and normal gravity,"In order to investigate the mechanism of carbon combustion and to assess the importance of gravitational induced convection on the process, zero and normal gravity experiments were conducted in which spectroscopic carbon rods were resistance ignitied and burned in dry oxygen environments. In the zero-gravity drop tower tests, a blue flame surrounded the rod, showing that a gas phase reaction in which carbon monoxide was oxidized to carbon dioxide was taking place. The ratio of flame diameter to rod diameter was obtained as a function of time. It was found that this ratio was inversely proportional to both the oxygen pressure and the rod diameter. In the normal gravity tests, direct mass spectrometric sampling was used to measure gas phase concentrations. The gas sampling probe was positioned near the circumference of a horizontally mounted 0.615 cm diameter carbon rod, either at the top or at angles of 45 deg to 90 deg from the top, and yielded concentration profiles of CO2, CO, and O2 as a function of distance from the surface. The mechanism controlling the combustion process was found to change from chemical process control at the 90 deg and 45 deg probe positions to mass transfer control at the 0 deg probe position at the top of the rod. Under the experimental conditions used, carbon combustion was characterized by two surface reactions, 2C + O2 yields 2CO and CO2 + C yields 2CO, and a gas phase reaction, 2CO + O2 yields 2CO2.",2013-09-04,1981-05-01,/api/citations/19810013786/downloads/19810013786.pdf,/api/citations/19810013786/downloads/19810013786.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810014944,QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RELIABILITY,Comparative analysis of techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of aircraft computing systems,"Performability analysis is a technique developed for evaluating the effectiveness of fault-tolerant computing systems in multiphase missions. Performability was evaluated for its accuracy, practical usefulness, and relative cost. The evaluation was performed by applying performability and the fault tree method to a set of sample problems ranging from simple to moderately complex. The problems involved as many as five outcomes, two to five mission phases, permanent faults, and some functional dependencies. Transient faults and software errors were not considered. A different analyst was responsible for each technique. Significantly more time and effort were required to learn performability analysis than the fault tree method. Performability is inherently as accurate as fault tree analysis. For the sample problems, fault trees were more practical and less time consuming to apply, while performability required less ingenuity and was more checkable. Performability offers some advantages for evaluating very complex problems.",2013-09-04,1981-04-01,/api/citations/19810014944/downloads/19810014944.pdf,/api/citations/19810014944/downloads/19810014944.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The HCMM digital data, produced by NASA were processed by NOAA/NESS into image and line-printer form. A LANDSAT image of the lake illustrates the relationship between MSS band 7 data and the HCMM data as processed by the NASA image processing facility which transforms the data to the same distortion-free hotline oblique Mercator projection. Spatial correlation of the two images is relatively simple by either digital or analog means and the HCMM image has a potential accuracy approaching the 80 m of the original LANDSAT data. While it is difficult to get readings that are not diluted by radiation from cooler adjacent land areas in narrow portions of the lake, digital data indicated by the line-printer display five different temperatures for open-water areas. Where the water surface response was not diluted by land areas, the temperature difference recorded by HCMM corresponds to in situ readings with rsme on the order of 1 C.",2013-08-11,1980-03-03,/api/citations/19810015012/downloads/19810015012.pdf,/api/citations/19810015012/downloads/19810015012.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810016294,STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY,Calculation of power spectrums from digital time series with missing data points,"Two algorithms are developed for calculating power spectrums from the autocorrelation function when there are missing data points in the time series. Both methods use an average sampling interval to compute lagged products. One method, the correlation function power spectrum, takes the discrete Fourier transform of the lagged products directly to obtain the spectrum, while the other, the modified Blackman-Tukey power spectrum, takes the Fourier transform of the mean lagged products. Both techniques require fewer calculations than other procedures since only 50% to 80% of the maximum lags need be calculated. The algorithms are compared with the Fourier transform power spectrum and two least squares procedures (all for an arbitrary data spacing). Examples are given showing recovery of frequency components from simulated periodic data where portions of the time series are missing and random noise has been added to both the time points and to values of the function. In addition the methods are compared using real data.

19810016318,ACOUSTICS,On the generation of side-edge flap noise,A theory is proposed for estimating the noise generated at the side edges of part span trailing edge flaps in terms of pressure fluctuations measured just in-board of the side edge of the upper surface of the flap. Asymptotic formulae are developed in the opposite extremes of Lorentz contracted acoustic wavelength large/small compared with the chord of the flap. Interpolation between these limiting results enables the field shape and its dependence on subsonic forward flight speed to be predicted over the whole frequency range. It is shown that the mean width of the side edge gap between the flap and the undeflected portion of the airfoil has a significant influence on the intensity of the radiated sound. It is estimated that the noise generated at a single side edge of a full scale part span flap can exceed that produced along the whole of the trailing edge of the flap by 3 dB or more.,2013-09-04,1981-06-01,/api/citations/19810016318/downloads/19810016318.pdf,/api/citations/19810016318/downloads/19810016318.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Experimental data show that the spectral content of the acoustic signal is considerably broadened upon passing through such a shear layer. Theoretical analysis is presented which shows that such spectral broadening is entirely consistent with amplitude modulation of the acoustic signal by the time-varying shear layer. Thus, no actual frequency shift need be hypothesized to explain the spectral phenomenon. Experimental tests were conducted at 2, 4, and 6 kHz and at free jet flow velocities of 10, 20, and 30 m/s.

These results are consistent with upwelling and divergence in this part of the atmosphere. A hot spot and a barge, which are localized cyclonic features, are found to be warm relative to their surroundings, implying subsidence with accompanying convergence. In all cases, the thermal wind shear associated with the features indicates a decay of the vorticity with height in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Vertical velocities inferred from the observed temperature perturbations imply an upper limit of vertical mixing times near the tropopause of approximately 20 years.

The synergistic data are reasonably well estimated or bracketed by the high- and low-angle-of-attack vortex lift theories over the Mach number range and up to maximum lift or strake-vortex breakdown over the wing. Also, the strake geometry is very important in the maximum lift value generated and the lift efficiency of a given additional area. Increasing size and slenderness ratios are important is generating lift efficiently, but similar efficiency can also be achieved by designing a strake with approximately half the area of the largest gothic strake tested.

19810016745,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Noise and interference study for satellite lightning sensor,"The use of radio frequency techniques for the detection and monitoring of terrestrial thunderstorms from space are discussed. Three major points are assessed: (1) lightning and noise source characteristics; (2) propagation effects imposed by the atmosphere and ionosphere; and (3) the electromagnetic environment in near space within which lightning RF signatures must be detected. A composite frequency spectrum of the peak of amplitude from lightning flashes is developed. Propagation effects (ionospheric cutoff, refraction, absorption, dispersion and scintillation) are considered to modify the lightning spectrum to the geosynchronous case. It is suggested that in comparing the modified spectrum with interfering noise source spectra RF lightning pulses on frequencies up to a few GHz are detectable above the natural noise environment in near space.",2013-09-04,1981-05-06,/api/citations/19810016745/downloads/19810016745.pdf,/api/citations/19810016745/downloads/19810016745.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Local pressure coefficient distributions and normal force coefficients on the arrays are shown and compared to theoretical results. Parameters that were varied when determining the aerodynamic forces included tilt angle, array separation, ground clearance, protective wind barriers, and the effect of the wind velocity profile. Recommended design wind forces and pressures are presented, which envelop the test results for winds perpendicular to the array's longitudinal axis. This wind direction produces the maximum wind loads on the arrays except at the array edge where oblique winds produce larger edge pressure loads. The arrays located at the outer boundary of an array field have a protective influence on the interior arrays of the field. A significant decrease of the array wind loads were recorded in the wind tunnel test on array panels located behind a fence and/or interior to the array field compared to the arrays on the boundary and unprotected from the wind. The magnitude of this decrease was the same whether caused by a fence or upwind arrays.",2013-09-04,1981-04-01,/api/citations/19810016895/downloads/19810016895.pdf,/api/citations/19810016895/downloads/19810016895.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Several vegetative targets representative of natural and agricultural canopies were considered in two wavelength bands. All combinations of Sun and view angles between 5 and 85 degrees zenith for a range of azimuths were simulated to examine geometrical dependance arising from seasonal as well as latitudinal variation.

A computer-aided design study on the dependence of efficiency peaks on the concentrations of the recombination and dopant impurities is presented. The illuminated current voltage characteristics of over 100 cell designs were obtained using the transmission line circuit model to numerically solve the Shockley Equations. Using an AM1 efficiency of 17% as a target value, it is shown that the efficiency versus thickness dependence has a broad maximum which varies less than 1% over more than three-to-one range of cell thickness from 30 to 100 microns. Optical reflecting back surface will give only a slight improvement of AM1 efficiency, about 0.7%, in this thickness range. The sensitive dependence of efficiency on patchiness across the back surface field, low high junction in thin cells is noted.",2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19810016958/downloads/19810016958.pdf,/api/citations/19810016958/downloads/19810016958.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Experimental data indicate that the ease of ignition and explosion severity of dichlorosilane (DCS)/air mixtures is substantially attenuated if the DCS is diluted with hydrogen. Redesign of the process development unit to accommodate safety related information is described. Several different sources of trichlorosilane were used to generate a mixture of redistributed chlorosilanes via Dowex ion exchange resin. The unseparated mixtures were then fed to an experimental reactor in which silicon was deposited and the deposited silicon analyzed for electrically active impurities. At least one trichlorosilane source provided material of requisite purity. Silicon grown in the experimental reactor was converted to single crystal material and solar cells fabricated and tested.,2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19810016959/downloads/19810016959.pdf,/api/citations/19810016959/downloads/19810016959.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810017272,PLASMA PHYSICS,Goals of thermionic program for space power,"The thermionic and Brayton reactor concepts were compared for application to space power. For a turbine inlet temperature of 15000 K the Brayton powerplant weighted 5 to 40% less than the thermionic concept. The out of core concept separates the thermionic converters from their reactor. Technical risks are diminished by: (1) moving the insolator out of the reactor; (2) allowing a higher thermal flux for the thermionic converters than is required of the reactor fuel; and (3) eliminating fuel swelling's threat against lifetime of the thermionic converters. Overall performance can be improved by including power processing in system optimization for design and technology on more efficient, higher temperature power processors. The thermionic reactors will be larger than those for competitive systems with higher conversion efficiency and lower reactor operating temperatures. It is concluded that although the effect of reactor size on shield weight will be modest for unmanned spacecraft, the penalty in shield weight will be large for manned or man-tended spacecraft.",2013-09-04,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810017272/downloads/19810017272.pdf,/api/citations/19810017272/downloads/19810017272.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The results indicate that, in the turbulent range of Reynolds number, good correlation of the local heat transfer coefficients is obtained when the physical properties and density of helium are evaluated at the surface temperature. The average heat transfer coefficients are best correlated on the basis that the coefficient varies with [1 + (L/D))(sup -0,7)] and that the physical properties and density are evaluated at the surface temperature. The average friction coefficients for the tests with no heat addition are in complete agreement with the Karman-Nikuradse line.

The method, which uses the natural fluctuations of the atmosphere to probe its dynamics, is tested here using a twenty-variable truncation model of the barotropic vorticity equation. Dissipative terms are added to the equations, so that the model is pushed away from the region where it is expected to satisfy the FDT. It is found that, even though the FDT is no longer satisfied in every detail, the FDT continues to provide an excellent estimate of the climatic sensitivity of the model.",2013-08-11,1980-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The kamacite, taenite, tetrataenite, and troilite in Weston and Fayetteville have many textures; on a Wood plot of the central Ni content vs dimensions, the taenite content shows scatter if metal grains had cooled at rates of 10-1000 and 1-100 K/Myr through 700 K. In contrast, metallic minerals in Bhola and Mezo-Madaras have uniform textures and plot coherently, indicating cooling rates of 0.1 and 1 K/Myr, respectively, in the 700-600 K range.

As expected, the magnitude of the refraction decreases as the real part of the admittance increases.

Some global properties of fully MHD Bianchi I relativistic models are analyzed including vorticity, fluid accelerations, and dissipative effects. The time dependence of perturbations of a fully MHD diagonal Bianchi I cosmology is studied, with an enhanced growth rate of the density contrast of t found which is still not exponential Jeans-type growth.

The possibility of reducing the power loss by arranging solar cell strings in repeated small-area modules to eliminate any large areas at high potentials is investigated. It is found that the difference in power loss between modular and linear patterned high-voltage arrays is fairly small. Although the use of modular patterns can reduce the effective mean potential by about 10%, for the type of configuration being considered there is also a 10% increase in sheath area, leading to only a few percent change in total power loss.

Titanium, which produces two deep levels in silicon, degrades cell performance by reducing bulk lifetime and thus cell short-circuit current. Electrically active grain boundaries induce carrier recombination in the bulk and depletion regions of the solar cell. Experimental data imply a small but measurable segregation of titanium into some grain boundaries of the polycrystalline silicon containing high Ti concentration. However, for the titanium-contaminated polycrystalline material used in this study, solar cell performance is dominated by the electrically active titanium concentration in the grains.

Amomalous base pressure trends and puzzling wall pressure patterns resulted. A flow-into-the-corner test was then devised, using a 90 deg trough behind a back step. A vortex pair, generated by the unsymmetrical squeezing of the shear layer, was found to fill much of the corner and provided an explanation for the peculiar results of the previous tests. No previous reference could be found to this phenomenon. Further experiments of bodies with base fins defined the conditions for creating this trough vortex effect.

Pressure recovery and flow losses were determined as a function of prediffuser inlet velocity profile, flow extraction at the prediffuser exit, and distribution of flow in the combustor. Inlet velocity profile and turbulence levels were found to have a pronounced effect on system performance. Flow extraction at the prediffuser exit was found to have little influence on system performance.

The normal-loose stiffness variation results due to bearing-clearance effects, while normal-tight stiffness variations result from rubbing over a portion of a rotor's orbit. The results demonstrate that 1/2 speed subharmonic motion can be explained as either a linear parametric-excitation phenomenon or as a stable nonlinear subharmonic motion. The 1/3 speed motion is shown to be possible due to the radial stiffness nonlinearity. A linear parametric-excitation analysis demonstrates that during a normal-tight rubbing condition, Coulomb damping significantly widens the potential range of unstable speeds.",2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The method is illustrated by applying it to the problem of pressure-sensitive combustion instability in a liquid-fuel annular combustion chamber. To the order of approximation inherent in the method it is found that the complete linear stability analysis and most of the nonlinear stability analysis can be carried out in closed form.

Both the model-generated climatology and an observed climatology were subjected to spherical harmonic analysis, with separate analyses of the globe and the Northern Hemisphere. Comparison of the dominant harmonics of the two climatologies indicates that more than 95% of the area-weighted spatial variance of G500 and more than 90% of that of T850 are explained by fewer than three components, and that the model adequately simulates these large-scale characteristics. On the other hand, as many as 25 harmonics are needed to explain 95% of the observed variance of SLP, and the model simulation of this field is much less satisfactory. The model climatology is also evaluated in terms of the annual cycles of the dominant harmonics.",2013-08-11,1981-02-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The solar analog found in earlier papers (Hardorp 1978, 1980) was chosen for these reductions, so these albedos are more reliable systematically than earlier ones and allow a choice among the scattering models of Savage et al. (1980). Green methane bands are stronger on Neptune. Strong solar absorption lines are found to be partially filled in by Raman-scattering. Neglect of this effect caused Croft et al. (1972) to find a solar color that is too blue.

The visual extinction for this region is determined from star counts on red and blue POSS prints. It is noted that most of the gas in the cloud is in the form of H2.

Measurements show clear evidence of anisotropy that is readily interpreted as due to the solar motion relative to the sources of the radiation. The anisotropy is well fitted by a first order spherical harmonic of amplitude 3.6 + or - 0.5 mK, corresponding to a velocity of 360 + or - 50 km/s toward the direction 11.2 + or - 0.5 hours of right ascension and 19 deg + or - 8 deg declination.",2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19810046669,ASTROPHYSICS,A variable mixing-length ratio for convection theory,It is argued that a natural choice for the local mixing length in the mixing-length theory of convection has a value proportional to the local density scale height of the convective bubbles. The resultant variable mixing-length ratio (the ratio between the mixing length and the pressure scale height) of this theory is enhanced in the superadiabatic region and approaches a constant in deeper layers. Numerical tests comparing the new mixing length successfully eliminate most of the density inversion that typically plagues conventional results. The new approach also seems to indicate the existence of granular motion at the top of the convection zone.,2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810046673,ASTROPHYSICS,The dissipation of inhomogeneous magnetic fields and the problem of coronae. I - Dislocation and flattening of flux tubes. II - The dynamics of dislocated flux,"Attention is given to the dynamical dissipation arising in a magnetic field extending up through a tenuous atmosphere when an elemental flux tube in the field (1) is displaced from its equilibrium position and/or (2) is inflated by an internal fluid pressure different from the external fluid pressure. It is pointed out that as a consequence the tension in the lines of force of the ambient field flattens the dislocated tube so that the thickness of the tube decreases without limit and that the local field gradients increase rapidly with the passage of time until destroyed by one or more dissipative effects. The magnetic energy of a dislocated flux tube is therefore soon converted into thermal energy no matter how low the molecule resistivity of the fluid. Some formal illustrations of local conditions along a misaligned flux tube are presented, showing the simultaneous onset of diffusion, fluid motion, and hydromagnetic wave propagation. The examples demonstrate that the total effect is complicated and subject only to estimation, rather than formal calculation, at the present time.",2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The behavior of emission measure and temperature with time is analyzed for the hot plasma confined in a segment at the top of a loop, taking into account the effects or the time variation of the confining toroidal magnetic field, the longitudinal expansion of the source through the motion of a pair of collisionless conduction fronts and unspecified heating or cooling processes. Analytic expressions for the behavior of the toroidal magnetic field and the heating rate necessary to reproduce a given behavior of emission measure and temperature with time are obtained in terms of the initial magnetic field strength and density of the heated region and a characteristic longitudinal expansion time. Results are applied to observations of two impulsive solar hard X-ray bursts, and it is shown that the contribution of heating is negligible after the first few seconds of the events, although significant nonadiabatic heating occurs early in the events.",2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810046675,SOLAR PHYSICS,Heating of the solar chromosphere by ionization pumping,"A new theory is proposed to explain the heating of the solar chromosphere, and possibly the corona, by the dissipation of hydrodynamic compression waves. The basis of the dissipative mechanism, here referred to as ionization pumping, is hysteresis caused by irreversible relaxation of the chromospheric medium to ionization equilibrium following pressure perturbations. In the middle chromosphere, where hydrogen is partially ionized, it is shown that ionization pumping will cause strong dissipation of waves whose periods are 200s or less. This could cause heating of the chromosphere sufficient to compensate for the radiative losses. The mechanism retains a high efficiency for waves of arbitrarily small amplitude and, thus, can be more efficient than shock dissipation for small perturbations in pressure. The formation of shocks therefore is not required for the dissipation of waves whose periods are several minutes or less.",2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The transfer film of PTFE on the metal was examined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In all cases the film was found to be indistinguishable from bulk PTFE. A trace of metal fluoride was observed whether the rubbing took place on oxidized or atomically clean metal. The film was of the order of a molecule thick for the entire range of loads and did not increase with repeated passes over the same rubbed area. An erratic increase in thickness at rubbing speeds above 10 mm/s was taken as evidence of random transfer of bulk material.,2013-08-11,1981-02-16,,,CDMS,OTHER,

In addition, detailed models of the gravitational lens effect were computed. These models, which can explain all optical and radio data for the system, predict delays of up to five years between variations in the A and B images (with A preceding B). It is suggested that the third image is rather faint and located close to the center of the lens galaxy; it is possible that this third image contributes to the observed galaxy core.

19810046964,AERODYNAMICS,Effectiveness of leading-edge vortex flaps on 60 and 75 degree delta wings,A series of wind tunnel tests were run on 60 and 75 deg sweep delta wings to examine the effectiveness of leading-edge vortex flaps. Tests results showed that leading-edge vortex flaps are effective in giving large increases in lift-to-drag ratio and decreases in drag over a wide range of angle of attack. Tests on inverted flaps on the 60 deg delta wing showed substantial increases in lift and drag and may indicate a possibility of using inverted flaps on delta wings in the landing portion of flight. The 60 deg data were compared with that for a 75 deg sweep delta wing confirming that leading-edge vortex flap effectiveness is stronger as sweep is increased. Pitching moment effects due to vortex flaps use were also examined.,2013-08-11,1981-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

A broad absorption trough in the 2000-3000 A region is observed which may be produced by opacity in the fundamental cyclotron frequency for surface magnetic fields from 3.2 to 5 x 10 to the 8th gauss. The absence of a strong Lyman-alpha sigma + component suggests that the primary atmospheric constituent is not hydrogen, with various absorption features probably attributable to Zeeman components of neutral helium, or possibly Mg II, C II and other metal lines.

Vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor density were obtained from a total of 240 radiosonde launches taken simultaneously at three New England locations in 1974; all studies were made at the 19 and 22.2 GHz frequency operating range of the radiometers. The wet path length in the zenith direction could be estimated from the surface water vapor density to an accuracy of 5 cm for the summer data and 2 cm for winter data, and with the brightness temperatures, it could be estimated to an accuracy of 0.3 cm. Two dual-frequency radiometers were also used to determine the accuracy of prediction of the path length from real radiometry data.

The experiment is based on a mechanism in which the electrons in optically active molecules possess a helicity of less than 0.001, too weak to detect in radiolysis experiments, the sign of which depends on the chirality of the isomer. A helicity-dependent asymmetry is sought in the formation of the triplet ground state of positronium when a low-energy beam of polarized positrons of reversible helicity interacts with an optically active substance coating a channel electron multiplier. Asymmetries between positronium decays observed at positive and negative helicities for the same substance can thus be determined with a sensitivity of 0.0001, which represents a factor of 100 improvement over previous positronium experiments.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The computed electric fields are found to compare satisfactorily with electric fields measured from S3-2, although there are detailed differences. The three general features on which the model and observations are in good agreement are (1) the magnitude and direction of the high-latitude electric field, (2) the degree to which the low-latitude ionosphere is shielded from the high-latitude convection electric field, and (3) the fact that the poleward electric field on the duskside is significantly larger, on the average, than the equatorward electric field on the dawnside.

It is noted that all measurements were carried out in the vicinity of the geomagnetic equatorial plane and that the data show the varying effects of four major magnetic storm periods. Orders of magnitude increases in the trapped heavy ion population are seen deep within the radiation belts following the August 1972 solar flare and magnetic storm events. Fluxes of the Z greater than or equal to 4 ions are found to decay faster than those of helium ions of comparable energies; typical decay times for these ions are found to be 24-40 days at L less than or equal to 4 and shorter at higher L shells. The observations are compared with the expected post-injection long-term behavior of atomic oxygen ions deduced from charge exhange, radial diffusive transport, and Coulomb collisions.

Nearly simultaneous phase scintillation data from the Wideband satellite were also spectrally analyzed for comparison with the AE-E data. The same systematic decrease of the spectral index with increasing perturbation strength was found in the measured phase spectral indices.

Response time is seen as a major factor determining the possible survival and/or protection of property. These criteria, can not be met by existing communications systems and complete blackouts were experienced during the past decades caused by either interruption or destruction of existing power lines, and overload or inadequacy of remaining lines. Several emergency cases, caused by either hurricanes, tornados, or floods, during which communication via satellite was instrumental to inform rescue and relief teams, are described in detail.

Transmission electron microscopy examination of cycled specimens indicated that even an exposure of 10 minutes effected noticeable changes in the shape of the alpha phase, and that the changes were cumulative as more cycles were added. The cross sections of fine, smooth fibers changed from rectangles to octagons, while lamellae and irregular shapes spheroidized. These effects are attributed to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the alpha phase and the gamma/gamma-prime matrix, and to the higher diffusion rates prevailing at elevated temperatures. Where the configuration of the alpha phase is a simple shape, such as a fiber, increasing the temperature eventually brings about a stress free interface between the alpha phase and the matrix by differential thermal expansion. Where the shape of the alpha phase is more complex, a stressed interface persists to higher temperatures where diffusion produces the more drastic morphological changes.",2013-08-11,1981-02-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The relationship between scattering intensity, cross section, and the geometrical integral called 'effective path length' is derived. Volume correction factors (the reciprocal of effective path length) have been calculated for sample cases to illustrate the effect of various beam and scattering geometry characteristics.

This unexpected overabundance of He(+) was observed in each of the three large solar-flare particle events which occurred between 1978 August and 1979 October. The data were obtained with the Max-Planck-Institut/University of Maryland Experiment on board the ISEE-3 spacecraft.

19810053529,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,A comparison of the thermal and radar characteristics of Mars,"Results of thermal infrared sensing and radar observations of the Martian surface are compared for the region centered on +22 deg latitude. Values of the apparent thermal inertia of the surface were derived from surface brightnesses observed by the Viking Orbiter Infrared Thermal Mapper, while radar cross sections were obtained in earth-based experiments at wavelengths of 3.8, 12.5 and 70 cm. A correlation between the thermal inertia and radar cross section values is observed which is strongest with the 70-cm radar data except between longitudes of 10 and 90 deg, where a slight anticorrelation is found. The mixing of small (much less than 70 cm) rocks into a surface of fine material can account for the data between 90 and 370 deg longitude, with as much as 50% of the surface covered by rock in Syrtis Major, Isidis Planitia and parts of Elysium Planitia, and little or no rock cover near Olympus Mons, Elysium Mons, and Amazonis Planitia. The remaining longitudes may be explained in terms of the effects of atmospheric dust on the surface temperature or the effects of local variations in large-scale roughness or scattering from rocks. Data from the 90 to 370 deg longitude region are consistent with the division of the Martian surface into two types of terrain, possibly related to the erosional or depositional nature of the regions.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Rock types similar in chemical and mineralogical composition include terrestrial Archean basalts and certain achondrite meteorites. If these igneous rocks weathered nearly isochemically, the nontronitic clays proposed earlier as an analog to Martian fines could be formed. Flood basalts of pyroxenitic lavas may be widespread and characteristic of early volcanism on Mars, analogous to maria flood basalts on the moon and early Precambrian basaltic komatiites on earth.

Small amounts of water ice are incorporated into the annual CO2 cap; this water is released at the cap margin when it retreats in the spring. The first global dust storm resulted in heating of the south arctic atmosphere and a transport of water in from the equatorial region. The second global dust storm had a negligible effect on atmospheric water vapor; the dust contained little water.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810053540,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Weathering of Mars - Antarctic analog studies,"Subaerial extrusion of lavas above permafrost is proposed as a possible weathering regime leading to the presence of Martian surface fines, and the characteristics of this process are examined through a study of the analogous altered terrestrial basalts from Antarctica. On the basis of mineralogical and petrological analyses of samples obtained from core cuttings recovered by the Dry Valley Drilling Program from rocks predominantly of an aklalic basalt-phonolite suite, it is found that in the absence of liquid water, weathering is geologically slow, and that zeolites predominate over clays as secondary mineral. Of the possible weathering processes proposed for Mars, it is concluded that both subaerial extrusion and subpermafrost intrusion of lavas involving liquid water would be less important volumetrically than the hydrothermal alteration of impact melt sheets if water were present during an intense phase of early bombardment, or than subsequent solid-gas alteration reactions. It is thus predicted that the present Martian fines should contain a major contribution from the ancient crust as typified by the southern cratered highlands, and a lesser contribution from the younger basaltic lavas.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Geochemical measurements and chemical relationships constrain the salt species and resultant physicochemical consequences. A likely assemblage is dominated by (Mg,Na)SO4, NaCl, and (Mg,Ca)CO3. Formation of brine in equilibrium with such a salt mixture is unlikely under the temperature and water-vapor restrictions prevalent over most, if not all, of the Martian surface.

The COSAL code uses a matrix finite-difference method for local eigenvalue solution when a good guess for the eigenvalue is available and is significantly more computationally efficient than the commonly used initial-value approach. The local eigenvalue search procedure also results in eigenfunctions and, at little extra work, group velocities. A globally convergent eigenvalue procedure is also developed which may be used when no guess for the eigenvalue is available.

Solid samples of mixed sulfides and sulfates from mounds, chimneys and the surrounding sediment as well as fresh basaltic glass were examined with a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and electron microprobe analysis. For the three vents of exit temperature close to 350 C, the chimneys are found to be rich in copper sulfides, while for those of temperatures around 300 C, zinc sulfide is found to predominate. The major sulfides found in the chimneys include wurtzite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and cubanite, with anhydrite the dominant sulfate. Significant mineralogical differences are found between active and inactive vents. The isotopic composition of sulfur in anhydrites from active vents is observed to be close to that of sea water and consistent with a derivation from sea water sulfate. The isotopic composition of sulfur in the sulfide minerals is explained in terms of precipitation from solutions with reduced sulfur derived from basalts or basaltic magmas, and sea water sulfate.

19810054441,AEROSPACE MEDICINE,Hemodynamic changes during whole body surface cooling and lower body negative pressure,"Six young healthy male subjects were studied to evaluate the use of whole body surface cooling (WBSC) as an antiorthostatic intervention. Previous studies have demonstrated that perfusion of an Apollo cooling garment with 16 C water produced a significant increase in stroke volume and decrease in heart rate at rest and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). However, optimal perfusion temperatures have not been determined. The present study examined the effects of WBSC using perfusion of water at a temperature of 10 C. This perfusion temperature produced a greater decrease in mean skin temperature than water at 16 C (4 C drop compared to 2 C). The hemodynamic effects were also more prominent with 10 C water as shown by the increase in stroke volume of 11% at rest and of 35% during LBNP at -50 torr compared to control measurements at ambient temperature. Heart rates were lowered significantly (8 beats/min) and systolic arterial blood pressure was higher (8 torr). Cooling with 10 C water produced a slight increase in muscle tone, reflected by a small but significant increase (+84 ml/min) in oxygen uptake. These data suggest that WBSC is an effective nonpharmacologic means of controlling preload and deserves further investigation as an antiorthostatic intervention.",2013-08-11,1981-07-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is found that determining a periodic solution of this three-coefficient model also reduces to finding the algebraic roots of a real polynomial. In the derivation of this polynomial, a class of hydrodynamic spectral systems is described for which a periodic solution might be similarly specified. The existence of periodic solutions of the three-coefficient model is controlled by the roots of the stability polynomial of the basic stationary solution, which represents the simplest response to the constant forcing. When the forcing exceeds a critical value, the basic solution becomes unstable. Owing to the nature of the roots of the stability polynomial at critical forcing, bifurcation theory guarantees the existence of a periodic solution.",2013-08-11,1981-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Since actual topography does not have the large y scales postulated by Hart, his model was modified in the current investigation to obtain equations with arbitrary zonal variations of topography by projecting all variable functions onto the first topographic cross-stream mode. The topographic heights and streamfunctions are expanded as Fourier series in the cross-stream coordinate and the series are truncated after the first term. This accomplishes Hart's results but permits more realistic y variations in the topography. The present investigation is the first in a two-part series.

Many flux variations correlate with directional changes of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Particles propagating in the upstream region acted on by the solar wind electric field creates a quasi-stationary particle pattern in space. Evidently, the spacecraft frequently crosses the boundaries of these particle patterns. The present analysis strongly suggests that the particle time variations are usually spatial variations that have been convoluted into our data. Estimates of the thickness of the particle boundaries deduced is greater than or approximately equal to the Larmor radius (for both the upstream electron and the ion events). Plasma waves are observed in association with the upstream particle fluxes and a correlation between the amplitudes and the particle boundaries is suggested.

It is also found that ions observed in the foreshock region display gyrophase organization produced by ion clusters with a spatial scale of less than 1 Rg, and that dispersed ion distributions are produced primarily by direct sources at or near the bow shock.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

An intrinsically dissipative difference scheme and a fully implicit treatment of boundary conditions, based on characteristic and conservation concepts, are used to improve stability and accuracy. Efficiency is achieved by using a diagonal form of the implicit algorithm and spatially varying time-steps. Comparisons of various schemes and methods are presented for one- and two-dimensional flows, including transonic separated flow past a thick circular-arc airfoil in a channel.

An analysis of graphite vaporization, with commonly used vaporization coefficients, indicates that the maximum mass-loss rate from a conical shield as large as 4 m in diameter can be kept low enough to avoid interference with measurements of the solar environment. In addition to the mass-loss problem, the problem of protecting the payload from the high-temperature (up to 2300 K) primary shield must be solved. An analysis of radiation exchange between concentric disks provides a technique for designing the intermediate shielding. The technique is applied to the design of a system for the Starprobe spacecraft, and it is found that a system with 10 shields and a payload surface temperature of 600 K will have a payload diameter of 2.45 m. Since this is 61% of the 4-m diameter of the primary shield, it is concluded that a graphitic heat-shield system is feasible for the Starprobe mission.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

This is accomplished by a mixture heat capacity ratio which automatically adjusts from its single phase values to approximately the isothermal value of unity needed for the minimum speed.

All three codes account for the hypersonic, massively blown, radiation shock layers, characteristic of Jupiter entry. Significant differences, however, are evident in their solution procedures: the governing conservation equations, the numerical differencing methods, the governing physics (chemical, radiation, diffusion, and turbulence models), and the basic physical data (thermodynamic, transport, chemical, and spectral properties for atomic and molecular species). Solutions are compared for two near peak heating entry conditions for a Galileo Probe baseline configuration, having an initial mass of 242 kg and simulating entry into the Orton nominal atmosphere.

TPS sizings are performed using entry trajectories tailored specifically to the characteristics of each TPS concept under consideration. Comparisons are made between systems previously sized under the assumption of all laminar heating and those sized using a baseline estimate of transition and turbulent heating.

Fast data collection may therefore be advantageous by minimizing drift time. The problem of fast data collection is accentuated when modulation data must be taken on a large number of detectors in a focal plane array. A method has been developed for the generation and storage of knife edge data from focal plane arrays, where data collection time per detector is in the submillisecond range. Once knife edge collects are completed, MTF response is found using conventional convolution techniques. SWR is obtained directly from knife edge response using a computerized simulation algorithm which bypasses use of MTF harmonics.

Calibration of the magnetometer included arc-second precision determination of the relative orientations of the three sensor axes in a coordinate system defined by optical references. This determination began with laboratory measurements of the relative alignments of optical components mounted with the magnetometer. The actual calibration procedure then consisted basically of accurate and repeatable positioning of the Vector Magnetometer within a unique magnetic test facility which nulls the earth's magnetic field, then generates magnetic fields of various orientations and strengths. Analysis of the magnetometer sensor outputs together with the position and alignment data then gave the axes orientations.

The two signals from the linearizers were sent through a sum and difference unit which was calibrated from dc to 100 kHz. The distributions of mean velocity and the turbulence shear stresses were measured in the two central planes of the jet stations up to 115 widths downstream of the nozzle exit. Three distinct regions characterized the jet flow field: a potential core origin, a two-dimensional-type region, and an axisymmetric type region. The onset of the second region appeared to be at a location where the shear layers separated by the short dimension of the nozzle meet; and the third region occurred at a downstream location where the two shear layers from the short edges of the nozzle meet. In the central plane, similarity was found both in the mean velocity and shear stress profiles beyond 30 widths downstream of the nozzle exit; profiles of rms velocity showed similarity in the second, but not the third region.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Analyses indicate that during the winter of 1976-1977 at Lorman, and the winter of 1977-1978 at Boulder, the plasmasphere content had no diurnal variation, although in the winter of 1974-1975 the peak occurred at night. Differences in diurnal behavior over North America and Europe are explained by a combination of plasma flow in and out of local and conjugate ionospheres. The difference appears to be temporal rather than spatial, thus, the cross-L drift of plasma tubes under the influence of electric fields is suggested to be an influence on the diurnal variation of the plasmaspheric columnar electron content.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Emphasis is on secondary acoustic wave effects giving rise to coupling mechanisms; and the simulation accounts for one-dimensional elastoacoustic coupling from a plane acoustic wave and secondary loads resulting from wave asymmetries. The transfer matrix approach is adopted in modeling the elastodynamics of each duct, with allowance for distribution loads. Secondary loads from plane wave distortion are considered with a solution of the Helmholtz equation in an equivalent rigid waveguide, and effects of path imperfection are introduced as a perturbation from the hypothetical perfectly straight pipe. Computations indicate that the one-dimensional acoustic assumption is valid for frequencies below one-half the first cut-off frequency, and the three-dimensional acoustic effects produce an increase in response levels near and above cut-off.",2013-08-11,1981-09-08,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19810064176,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,Thermal stress fracture in elastic-brittle materials,"The reported investigation shows that the assessment of the possibility of the thermal fracture of brittle materials depends upon an accurate evaluation of the thermal stresses and the determination of the resulting stress intensity factors. The stress intensity factors can be calculated in a variety of ways ranging from the very precise to approximate, but only for a limited number of geometries. The main difficulty is related to the determination of the thermal stress field because of its unusual character and its dependence upon boundary conditions at points far from the region of thermal activity. Examination of a number of examples suggests that the best visualization of the thermal stresses and any associated fracture can be made by considering the problem to be the combination of thermal and isothermal problems or by considering that the prime effect of the temperature is in the generation of thermal strains and that the thermal stresses are simply the result of the region trying to accommodate these strains.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810064203,AIRCRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,The role of the helical jet mode in aerodynamic noise generation,"The helical jet mode is modeled by an infinite helical vortex filament, and an exact analytical solution for the induced velocity field interior to the filament is derived. These expressions are then used to model the jet flow field and to analyze the high subsonic and supersonic jet noise generation. It is shown that noise will be generated directly if the helical mode convects or rotates. Reducing this noise by stabilizing the mode is difficult, since the self-induced velocities of the mode itself cause it to convect and rotate; the use of noncircular nozzles is suggested to eliminate the symmetry of the boundary condition. The helical mode can also generate noise indirectly by inducing time-dependent Coriolis accelerations on small-scale turbulence propagating in its induced velocity field. This suggests that any upstream turbulence generation has an enhanced potential for noise propagation when propagating in the presence of the helical mode.",2013-08-11,1981-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The development and subsequent effects of shocks in the acoustic quantities are of primary consideration. The analysis uses a method of matched asymptotic expansions, yielding a set of inner equations of motion and shock conditions valid in the near-sonic throat region. The analysis leads to a generalization of the 'equal area' relation of weak shock theory. The manner in which nonlinear effects increase with source strength, frequency, and throat Mach number is illustrated by the numerical results and corresponding graphs.

Far-field acoustic data and exhaust jet plume aerodynamic data are obtained for various combinations of exhaust jet velocity and simulated flight speed, with corrected microphone data at a constant 12.2 m arc distance, and scaled acoustic data at a sideline distance of 457 m. It is found that jet plume aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of lobed mixer exhaust systems are similar to those of a conical nozzle operating at the same specific thrust, although differences occur at high frequencies, where the sound pressure level of the mixer nozzle is 1-5 dB higher than that of a conical nozzle. In addition, no direct correlation is found between exit plane turbulence levels and plume development or acoustic characteristics for mixer exhaust configurations.",2013-08-11,1981-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810064236,ACOUSTICS,Acoustic and turbulence measurements of a tone-excited jet with and without flight simulation,"Acoustic as well as turbulence measurements were made of tone-excited jets to obtain an understanding of the broadband noise augmentation mechanism. Results for both heated and unheated jets with and without flight simulation are presented for a range of excitation frequencies and levels, as well as for the zero order and first order spinning modes. It is argued that although the phase-locked large-scale turbulence structure is at the root of the noise amplification process, the actual noise generation mechanism lies in the small-scale turbulence. Results show that (1) the phase velocity of the excited large scale instability waves is subsonic relative to the ambient fluid and (2) broadband jet noise is almost uniform at all frequencies. Moreover, when the large-scale and small-scale structures are plotted against forward velocity (for a given upstream excitation level of 141 dB), the change in large-scale turbulence is negligible with forward velocity, whereas the small-scale turbulence decreases for both excited and unexcited jets. Also, the corresponding difference in far-field noise does not appear to change significantly, indicating that the changes in small-scale turbulence are responsible for jet noise amplification.",2013-08-11,1981-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Spacecraft measurements of the abundances of He, O, Si, Fe, Ne, and Ar with respect to H in the solar wind are shown to agree with relative abundance measurements of these elements in the solar photosphere and corona, while the lack of evidence of systematic depletion with increasing ionic mass suggests solar abundances of the much less abundant Kr and Xe in the solar wind. Relative He, Ne and Ar abundances in the ancient solar wind as derived from lunar ilmenite and the Pesyanoe meteorite are similar to present-day values, except for a factor of two underabundance of He, while the heavy rare gases appear to be enriched by up to a factor of five. The isotopic compositions of solar wind Ar, Kr and Xe have apparently been fairly constant over most of the solar lifetime, whereas He and possibly Ne show evidence of an increasing abundance of their heavy isotopes with increasing solar wind age.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Oemler (1976) and de Vaucouleurs (1948) laws are fitted to the profiles to derive structural parameters, and the structural properties of the galaxies are compared with those of the cD galaxies in rich clusters studied by Oemler (1976) and those of normal ellipticals studied by Kormendy (1977). It is found that (1) the profiles of first brightest galaxies are well fitted by an r to the 1/4 power law over a range of more than nine magnitudes and down to the faintest light levels observed and (2) structural parameters characterizing only the central part of first brightest galaxies in poor and rich clusters, and excluding the envelope component in the case of rich clusters, smoothly extend properties exhibited by normal ellipticals.

Absorption cross sections were measured at wavelengths between 185 and 300 nm in a double-beam spectrometer at temperatures of 295 and 225 K. The results are found to be in good agreement with previous reports in the short wavelength region, but significantly lower than the value of 2 x 10 to the 22nd sq cm/molecule proposed by Rudolf and Inn (1981) between 280 and 300 nm, which may be attributed to trace contaminants or dimerization. A marked temperature effect is noted at wavelengths greater than 240 nm and below 190 nm. As no evidence of absorption at wavelengths greater than 270 nm was found, estimates of the solar photodissociation rate of tropospheric OCS based on the present cross sections yield a value of about 2 x 10 to the -9th/sec, corresponding to a tropospheric lifetime of about 20 years.

The polar and equatorial electrostatic tension for axis ratios between 0.01 and 1000 are calculated, and the polar pressure is found to be larger than the equatorial pressure for prolate spheroids. The electrostatic polar pressure profile along the polar axis for prolate spheroids is calculated, and the pressure is found to increase monotonically from a minimum at the center to a maxima at the ends. This indicates that as a prolate spheroid of uniform tensile strength is charged up, it will continue to chip off at the ends when the electrostatic pressure there exceeds the uniform tensile strength of the grain.

19810064941,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,ICAP - An Interactive Cluster Analysis Procedure for analyzing remotely sensed data,"An Interactive Cluster Analysis Procedure (ICAP) was developed to derive classifier training statistics from remotely sensed data. ICAP differs from conventional clustering algorithms by allowing the analyst to optimize the cluster configuration by inspection, rather than by manipulating process parameters. Control of the clustering process alternates between the algorithm, which creates new centroids and forms clusters, and the analyst, who can evaluate and elect to modify the cluster structure. Clusters can be deleted, or lumped together pairwise, or new centroids can be added. A summary of the cluster statistics can be requested to facilitate cluster manipulation. The principal advantage of this approach is that it allows prior information (when available) to be used directly in the analysis, since the analyst interacts with ICAP in a straightforward manner, using basic terms with which he is more likely to be familiar. Results from testing ICAP showed that an informed use of ICAP can improve classification, as compared to an existing cluster analysis procedure.",2013-08-11,1981-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Modulation of the fluorescence decay signal was observed as a function of both time and space and can be interpreted in terms of a classical precession of the excited atom about the magnetic field or as quantum beats resulting from interference between coherently populated Zeeman sublevels. This modulation was studied for each of the five resolvable components of the hyperfine structure separately. The fluorescence from the even isotopes was determined to be almost completely modulated while the fluorescence from the odd isotopes was only partially modulated. The frequency of modulation of the fluorescence from the mercury-202 isotope was observed as a function of the applied magnetic field and a value for the Lande factor of 1.46 + or - 0.03 was obtained. This is within experimental error of the accepted value of 1.486.

19810068591,AERODYNAMICS,Investigation of Aerodynamic and Icing Characteristics of Recessed Fuel-Vent Configurations,"An investigation has been conducted in the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel to determine the aerodynamic and icing characteristics of several recessed fuel-vent configurations. The vents were investigated aerodynamically to obtain vent-tube pressures and pressure distributions on the ramp surface as functions of tunnel-air velocity and angle of attack. Icing investigations were made to determine the vent-tube pressure losses for several icing conditions at tunnel-air velocities ranging from 220 to 440 feet per second. In general, under nonicing conditions, the configurations with diverging ramp walls maintained, vent-tube pressures greater than the required marginal value of 2 inches of water positive pressure differential between the fuel cell and the compartment containing the fuel cell for a range of angles of attack from 0 to 14deg at a tunnel-air velocity of approximately 240 feet per second. A configuration haying divergIng ramp sldewalls, a 7deg ramp angle; and vent tubes manifold,ed to a common plenum chamber opening through a slot In the ramp floor gave the greatest vent-tube pressures for all the configurations investigated. The use of the plenum chamber resulted in uniform pressures in all vent tubes. In a cloud-icing condition, roughness caused by ice formations on the airfoil surface ahead of the vent ramp, rather than icing of the vent configuration, caused a rapid loss in vent-tube pressures during the first few minutes of an icing period. Only the configuration having diverging ramp sidewalls, a 7 ramp angle, and a common plenum chamber maintained the required vent-tube pressures throughout a 60-minute icing period, although the ice formations on this configuration were more severe than those observed for the other configurations. No complete closure of vent-tube openings occurred for the configurations investigated. A simulated freezing-rain condition caused a greater and more rapid vent-tube pressure loss than was observed for a cloud-icing condition.",2013-08-11,1949-03-01,/api/citations/19810068591/downloads/19810068591.pdf,/api/citations/19810068591/downloads/19810068591.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Required heat-transfer and air-pressure-loss equations are presented, and methods of selecting appropriate meteorological conditions for flight over specified geographical areas and for the calculation of water-drop-impingement characteristics are suggested. In order to facilitate the design, a simple electrical analogue was devised which solves the complex heat-transfer relationships existing in the thermal-system analysis.

19810068604,"AIRCRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",Effectiveness of Thermal-Pneumatic Airfoil-Ice-Protection System,"Icing and drag investigations were conducted in the NACA Lewis icing research tunnel employing a combination thermal-pneumatic de-icer mounted on a 42-inch-chord NACA 0018 airfoil. The de-icer consisted of a 3-inch-wide electrically heated strip symmetrically located about the leading edge with inflatable tubes on the upper and lower airfoil surfaces aft of the heated area. The entire de-icer extended to approximately 25 percent of chord. A maximum power density of 9.25 watts per square inch was required for marginal ice protection on the airfoil leading edge at an air temperature of 00 F and an airspeed of 300 miles per hour. Drag measurements indicated, that without icing, the de-icer installation increased the section drag to approximately 140 percent of that of the bare airfoil; with the tubes inflated, this value increased to a maximum of approximately 620 percent. A 2-minute tube-inflation cycle prevented excessive ice formation on the inflatable area although small scattered residual Ice formations remained after inflation and were removed intermittently during later cycles. Effects of the time lag of heater temperatures after initial application of power and the insulating effect of ice formations on heater temperatures were also determined.",2013-08-11,1951-04-13,/api/citations/19810068604/downloads/19810068604.pdf,/api/citations/19810068604/downloads/19810068604.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A modified production-model hollow steel propeller, was used for the investigation. Temperatures of the blade surfaces for several heating rates were measured under various tunnel Icing' conditions. Photographic observations of ice formations on blade surfaces and blade heat-exchanger effectiveness were obtained. With 50-percent partitioning of the blades, adequate icing protection at 1050 rpm was obtained with a heating rate of 26,000 Btu per hour per blade at the blade shank using an air temperature of 400 F with a flow rate of 280 pounds per hour per blade, which is one-third less heat than was found necessary for similar Ice protection with unpartitioned blades. The chordwise distribution of the applied heat, as determined by surface temperature measurements, was considered unsatisfactory with much of the heat dissipated well back of the leading edge. Heat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 56 percent also Indicated poor utilization of available heat. This effectiveness was, however, 9 percent greater than that obtained from unpartitioned blades.",2013-08-11,1948-05-01,/api/citations/19810068620/downloads/19810068620.pdf,/api/citations/19810068620/downloads/19810068620.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810068625,AIRCRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,The Effect of Ice Formations on Propeller Performance,"Measurements of propeller efficiency loss due to ice formation are supplemented by an analysis to establish the magnitude of efficiency losses to be anticipated during flight in icing conditions. The measurements were made during flight in natural icing conditions; whereas the analysis consisted of an investIgation of changes in blade-section aerodynamic characteristics caused by ice formation and the resulting propeller efficiency changes. Agreement in the order of magnitude of eff 1- ciency losses to be expected is obtained between measured and analytical results. The results indicate that, in general, efficiency losses can be expected to be less than 10 percent; whereas maximum losses, which will be encountered only rarely, may be as high as 15 or 20 percent. Reported. losses larger than 15 or 20 percent, based on reductions in airplane performance, probably are due to ice accretions on other parts of the airplane. Blade-element theory is used in the analytical treatment, and calculations are made to show the degree to which the aerodynamic characteristics of a blade section. must be altered to produce various propeller efficiency losses. The effects of ice accretions on airfoil-section characteristics at subcritical speeds and their influence on drag-divergence Mach number are examined, and. the attendant maximum efficiency losses are computed. The effect of kinetic heating on the radial extent of ice formation is considered, and its influence on required length of blade heating shoes is discussed. It is demonstrated how the efficiency loss resulting from an icing encounter is influenced by the decisions of the pilot in adjusting the engine and propeller controls.",2013-08-11,1950-10-01,/api/citations/19810068625/downloads/19810068625.pdf,/api/citations/19810068625/downloads/19810068625.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Total-pressure losses and icing characteristics for a direct-ram inlet and the inertia-separation inlets are compared at similar aerodynamic and simulated icing conditions. Complete ice protection for inlet guide vanes could not be achieved with the inertia-separation inlets investigated. Approximately 8 percent of the volume of water entering the nacelles remained. In the air passing into the compressor inlet. Heavy alternate-duct-elbow ice formations caused by secondary inertia separation resulted in rapid total-pressure losses and decreases in mass flow. The duration in an icing condition for an inertia-separation- inlet, without local surface heating, was increased approximately four times above that for a direct-ram inlet with a compressor-inlet screen. For normal nonicing operation, the inertia-separation- inlet total-pressure losses were comparable to a direct-ram installation. The pressure losses and the circumferential uniformity of the mass flow in all the inlets were relatively independent of angle of attack. Use of an inertia-separation inlet would in most cases require a larger diameter nacelle than a direct-ram inlet in order to obtain an alternate duct sufficiently large to pass the required engine air flow at duct Mach numbers below 1.0 at the minimum area.",2013-08-11,1950-07-26,/api/citations/19810068632/downloads/19810068632.pdf,/api/citations/19810068632/downloads/19810068632.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The amount of water in droplet form impinging on the airfoil, the area of droplet impingement, and the rate of droplet impingement per unit area on the airfoil surface were calculated from the trajectories and presented to cover a large range of flight and atmospheric conditions. The effect of a change in airfoil thickness from 12 to 4 percent at 4 deg angle of attack is presented by comparing the impingement calculations for the NACA 65A004 airfoil with those for the NACA 65(sub 1)-208 and 65(sub 1)-212 airfoils. The rearward limit of impingement on the upper surface decreases as the airfoil thickness decreases. The rearward limit of impingement on the lower surface increases with a decrease in airfoil t hickness.

Of particular interest was a device of 200 square centimeter optical aperture used on a satellite in a synchronous orbit. It was assumed that the reflector always faces the earth. The effects of direct solar irradiance, earthshine, and albedo were considered. The results included the maximum mirror surface temperature during the orbit as well as the worst-case loss of optical performance due to thermally-induced mirror distortions. It was concluded that a device made of three suitably coated flat ULE mirrors, optically contacted to each other and supported mechanically in a nonrigid mount, would be expected to concentrate over 80 percent of the theoretical maximum energy in the central of the far field diffraction pattern.

19820005194,AERODYNAMICS,Top-mounted inlet system feasibility for transonic-subsonic fighter aircraft applications,"To inlet flow field and engine inlet performance data for an advanced fighter aircraft configuration were obtained over the Mach 0.6 to 2.0 range. The studies not only provided extensive data for the baseline arrangement, but also evaluated the effects of key aircraft configuration variables (inlet location, canopy-dorsal integration, wing leading-edge extension planform area, and variable incidence canards) on top inlet performance. In order to set these data in the context of practical aircraft systems top inlet performance is compared with that of more conventional inlet/airframe integrations. The results of these evaluations show that, for the top inlet configuration tested, relatively good inlet performance and compatibility characteristics are maintained during subsonic and transonic maneuver. However, at supersonic speeds, flow expansion over the forebody and wings causes an increase in local inlet Mach number subsequently reduces inlet performance levels. These characteristics infer that although top inlets many not pose a viable design option for aircraft requiring a high degree of supersonic maneuverability, they have distinct promise for vehicles with subsonic and transonic maneuver capabilities.",2013-08-10,1981-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The flow in the inviscid zone, which surrounds most of the aircraft, is calculated using an existing potential flow code. The viscous flow zone, which encompasses the jet plume, is modeled using a parabolized Navier-Stokes code. The procedure features the coupling of the zonal solutions such that sufficient information is transferred between the zones to preserve the effects of the interactions. The zonal boundaries overlap and the boundary conditions are the information link between zones.

The light test data showed that pilot inputs to the hand controller reached peak-to-peak amplitudes of 20 deg at a frequency between 3 and 3.5 radians per second. The controller inputs were sufficient to exceed the priority rate limit set in the pitch axis. A nonlinear analytical study was conducted to investigate the combined effects of pilot input, rate limiting, and time delays. The frequency response of the total system is presented parametrically as a function of the three variables.

The Voyager spacecraft found notable deviations from the Parker axial model. These deviations are attributed both to temporal variations associated with increasing solar activity, and to the effects of fluctuations of the field in the radial direction. The amplitude of the latter fluctuations were found to be large relative to the magnitude of the radial field component itself beyond approximately 3 AU. Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 observed decreases with increasing heliocentric distance in the amplitude of transverse fluctuations in the averaged field strength (B) which are consistent with the presence of predominantly undamped Alfven waves in the solar wind, although and necessarily implying the presence of them.

The ERP measure reflected the control order variation, and this variable was thereby assumed to compete for perceptual/central processing resources.

Phase Plane performance analysis was conducted to study potential measures of workload or tracking difficulty.,2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005795/downloads/19820005795.pdf,/api/citations/19820005795/downloads/19820005795.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792
19820005816,MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT,A model for the submarine depthkeeping team,"The most difficult task the depthkeeping team must face occurs during periscope-depth operations during which they may be required to maintain a submarine several hundred feet long within a foot of ordered depth and within one-half degree of ordered pitch. The difficulty is compounded by the facts that wave generated forces are extremely high, depth and pitch signals are very noisy and submarine speed is such that overall dynamics are slow. A mathematical simulation of the depthkeeping team based on the optimal control models is described. A solution of the optimal team control problem with an output control restriction (limited display to each controller) is presented.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005816/downloads/19820005816.pdf,/api/citations/19820005816/downloads/19820005816.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792
19820005817,MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT,Modeling of the aircraft in-trail-following task during profile descent,"The cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) system concepts enable the pilot to observe the surrounding air traffic pattern. The impact of such a system is far reaching in terms of improved safety, pilot and controller workload, and aircraft fuel efficiency. One direct payoff is the ability to distribute the ATC workload to the pilot in such tasks as merging and spacing. The CDTI application of spacing approach aircraft in the terminal area is addressed. In-trail-following/CDTI experiments were performed using realistic cockpit simulators and profile descent approach scenarios. Based on collected experimental simulator data, pilot models were developed which include state estimation, decision making and flight control aspects. These models were coupled with models of aircraft and CDTI equipment to study the dynamic phenomena and stability of strings of aircraft along various approach patterns.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005817/downloads/19820005817.pdf,/api/citations/19820005817/downloads/19820005817.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792
19820005830,MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT,The influence of ship motion of manual control skills,"The effects of ship motion on a range of typical manual control skills were examined on the Warren Spring ship motion simulator driven in heave, pitch, and roll by signals taken from the frigate HMS Avenger at 13 m/s (25 knots) into a force 4 wind. The motion produced a vertical r.m.s. acceleration of 0.024g, mostly between 0.1 and 0.3 Hz, with comparatively little pitch or roll. A task involving unsupported arm movements was seriously affected by the motion; a pursuit tracking task showed a reliable decrement although it was still performed reasonably well (pressure and free moving tracking controls were affected equally by the motion); a digit keying task requiring ballistic hand movements was unaffected. There was no evidence that these effects were caused by sea sickness. The differing response to motion of the different tasks, from virtual destruction to no effect, suggests that a major benefit could come from an attempt to design the man/control interface onboard ship around motion resistant tasks.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005830/downloads/19820005830.pdf,/api/citations/19820005830/downloads/19820005830.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The preliminary control experiments were aimed at the investigation of the human operators' ability to command and control forces in different directions by varying the information conditions and the values of the feedforward and feedback command gains in the bilateral control loop. The main conclusions are: (1) a quantified graphic display of force-torque information can considerably enhance the operator's ability to perform a quantitatively sharp force-torque control, and (2) there seems to be a task dependent optimal combination of the feedforward and feedback command gain values which provide a dynamically smooth and stable bilateral control performance.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005834/downloads/19820005834.pdf,/api/citations/19820005834/downloads/19820005834.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

Substantial improvement in the accuracy of surface fire against attacking aircraft has been realized through the design of a director-type weapon control system. This system concept frees the gunner to exercise a supervisory/monitoring role while the computer takes over continuous target tracking. This change capitalizes on a key consideration of human factors engineering while increasing system accuracy. The advanced system design, which uses distributed microprocessor control, is discussed at the block diagram level and is contrasted with the previous implementation.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005842/downloads/19820005842.pdf,/api/citations/19820005842/downloads/19820005842.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The RPN calculator showed markedly superior resistance to interruption effects compared to the AN calculator although no significant differences were found when the users were not interrupted. Causes and possible remedies for interruption effects are speculated. It is proposed that because interruption is such a common occurrence, it be incorporated into comparative evaluation tests of different logic system and control/display system and that interruption resistance be adopted as a specific design criteria for such design.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005848/downloads/19820005848.pdf,/api/citations/19820005848/downloads/19820005848.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

A timer and four solenoid valves were installed so that the coolant flow can be reversed periodically. The hardware and software for controlling the analog to digital converter and conversion rate were completed, and the system is operational. A duty cycle control circit was implemented so that on the sixteenth conversion a relay shuts off the vibration exciter used to generate the sound wave. Thus the starting point of each decay curve is exactly known. This information is necessary for evaluating the g digital decay information.

Light scattering techniques can be applied to mixtures of particles (nephelometers) and to single particles as well. Measuring particle mixtures simplify detection because of the higher intensity level, however, information concerning the individual particle is lost. To provide well defined conditions over the whole rendezvous period, i.e., constant illumination beam and unchangeable scattering angle, the use of an artificial light source (instead of the sun) and a scattering volume located within the S/C is desirable. Considering this and the relatively low particle densities to be expected, the measurement of particle mixtures must be excluded.",2013-08-10,1981-10-01,/api/citations/19820006126/downloads/19820006126.pdf,/api/citations/19820006126/downloads/19820006126.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The investigation generated and compared three path update algorithms designed to provide smooth transition for an aircraft guidance system from DME, VORTAC, and barometric navaids to the more precise MLS by modifying the desired 3-D flight path. The first, called the Zero Cross Track, eliminates the discontinuity in cross track and altitude error by designating the first valid MLS aircraft position as the desired first waypoint, while retaining all subsequent waypoints. The discontinuity in track angle is left unaltered. The second, called the Tangent Path also eliminates the discontinuity in cross track and altitude and choose a new desired heading to be tangent to the next oncoming circular arc turn. The third, called the Continued Track eliminates the discontinuity in cross track, altitude and track angle by accepting the current MLS position and track angle as the desired ones and recomputes the location of the next waypoint. A method is presented for providing a waypoint guidance path reconstruction which treats turns of less than, and greater than, 180 degrees in a uniform manner to construct the desired path.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820008187/downloads/19820008187.pdf,/api/citations/19820008187/downloads/19820008187.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

All reactors were multielement configurations consisting of ceramic honeycomb catalyzed with palladium on stabilized alumina. Stable operation on residual oil was demonstrated with the baseline configuration at a reactor inlet temperature of about 825 K (1025 F). At low inlet temperature, operation was precluded by apparent plugging of the catalytic reactor with residual oil. Reduced plugging tendency was demonstrated in the backup reactors by increasing the size of the catalyst channels at the reactor inlet, but plugging still occurred at inlet temperature below 725 K (845 F).

When a field-aligned current is generated on auroral field lines, the disturbance propagates towards the ionosphere in the form of a kinetic Alfven wave. When the current exceeds a critical value, microscopic turbulence is produced, which modifies the propagation of the Alfven wave. This process is modeled by a nonlinear collision frequency, which increases with the excess of the drift velocity over the critical value. Turbulence leads to absorption and reflection of the Alfven wave, partially decoupling the generator from the ionosphere. The approach to a steady-state is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of the turbulence. The current is self-limiting, since a current in excess of critical causes a diffusion of the magnetic field perturbation and a reduction of current.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820008762/downloads/19820008762.pdf,/api/citations/19820008762/downloads/19820008762.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The kinematic viscosity of the liquid used in the model was 10,000 times higher than the viscosity of perilymph to attain hydrodynamic equality. Two different geometries for the sterocilia pattern were tested. First the force distribution for a W-shaped sterocilia pattern was recorded. This is the sterocilia pattern found in all real ears. It is found that the forces acting on the hairs are very regular and perpendicular to the legs of the W when the flow is directed from the outside of the W. When the flow is reversed, the forces are not reversed, but are much more irregular. This can eventually explain the half wave rectification of the nerve signals.

Voyager images were used to investigate the surface characteristics, geologic processes, and internal evolution of Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede shows two principal types of terrain: one dark, old, and heavily cratered; and another brighter, younger, and characterized by complex patterns of grooves. Voyager imagers were used to determine photometric properties of surface features on both bodies at phase angles up to 120 deg. Surface temperatures are calculated for the major terrain types. Callisto is found to be somewhat warmer than Ganymede. The temperature difference between grooved and cratered terrain on Ganymede is small.

19820009156,SOLAR PHYSICS,Effects of changes in convective efficiency on the solar radius and luminosity,A sequence of solar models has been constructed in order to investigate the sensitivity of the solar radius and luminosity to small changes in the ratio alpha of the mixing length lambda to the pressure-scale height Hp throughout the solar convective envelope. The basic procedure for determining this sensitivity was to impose a perturbation in alpha within the convective envelope and then to follow the resulting changes in the solar radius delta R and luminosity delta L for the next 10 to the 6th power yrs. These calculations gave the following results. (1) A perturbation in alpha produces immediate changes in the solar radius and luminosity. Initially delta L and delta alpha are related by delta L/L = 0.30 delta alpha/alpha. (2) The value of the ratio w = delta log R/delta log L is strongly time dependent. Its value just after the perturbation in alpha is 6.5 x 10 to the minus 4th power. (3) The ratio H = (delta log L) d delta log R/dt is much less time dependent and is a more suitable means for relating the changes in the solar radius and luminosity. (4) Both of these ratios imply that for any reasonable change in the solar luminosity the corresponding change in the solar radius is negligible.,2013-08-10,1981-12-01,/api/citations/19820009156/downloads/19820009156.pdf,/api/citations/19820009156/downloads/19820009156.txt,CDMS,PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820009140

As other phenomena in the same variability class we nominate the liminosity fluctuations of ZZ Ceti stars and the solar 160 m oscillation. We discuss the possibility that analogous physical mechanisms are at work in all these cases, namely instabilities driven in a thin layer. These instabilities should be favorable to grave modes (in angle) and should arise in conditions that may allow more than one kind of instability to occur at once. The interaction of these competing instabilities produces complicated temporal variations.

Developmental batteries used included nickel zinc batteries, a nickel iron battery, and an improved lead acid battery. Testing of the electric vehicles and upgraded batteries was performed in the complete vehicle system environment to characterize performance and identify problems unique to the vehicle/battery system.

The vehicle was tested on a chassis dynamometer over selected drive cycles and steady-state conditions. Two fuels were used, a United States number 2 diesel and a European diesel fuel. Particulate emission rates were calculated from dilution tunnel measurements and large volume particulate samples were collected for biological and chemical analysis. It was determined that turbocharging accompanied by complementary modifications results in small but substantial improvements in regulated emissions, fuel economy, and performance. Notably, particulate levels were reduced by 30 percent.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820010194/downloads/19820010194.pdf,/api/citations/19820010194/downloads/19820010194.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

An analytical approximation is also presented for the electron temperature distribution resulting from coulomb collisional heating. The dynamical, thermal, ionization, and spectral structures are calculated for blast waves of energy E sub 0 = 5 x 10 to the 50th power ergs in a hot low-density interstellar environment. A formula is presented for estimating the luminosity evolution of such explosions. The B and C bands of the soft X-ray background, it is shown, are reproduced by such a model explosion if the ambient density is about .000004 cm, the blast radius is roughly 100 pc, and the solar system is located inside the shocked region. Evolution in a pre-existing cavity with a strong density gradient may, it is suggested, remove both the M band and OVI discrepancies.",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19820010221/downloads/19820010221.pdf,/api/citations/19820010221/downloads/19820010221.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19820010222,ASTROPHYSICS,The distribution of free electrons in the inner galaxy from pulsar dispersion measures,The dispersion measures of a sample of 149 pulsars in the inner Galaxy (absolute value of l  50 deg) were statistically analyzed to deduce the large-scale distribution of free thermal electrons in this region. The dispersion measure distribution of these pulsars shows significant evidence for a decrease in the electron scale height from a local value greater than the pulsar scale height to a value less than the pulsar scale height at galactocentric radii inside of approximately 7 kpc. An increase in the electron density (to a value around .15/cu cm at 4 to 5 kpc) must accompany such a decrease in scale height. There is also evidence for a large-scale warp in the electron distribution below the b + 0 deg plane inside the Solar circle. A model is proposed for the electron distribution which incorporates these features and Monte Carlo generated dispersion measure distributions are presented for parameters which best reproduce the observed pulsar distributions.,2013-09-04,1981-12-01,/api/citations/19820010222/downloads/19820010222.pdf,/api/citations/19820010222/downloads/19820010222.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19820010239,SOLAR PHYSICS,The effect of perturbations of convective energy transport on the luminosity and radius of the Sun,"The response of solar models to perturbations of the efficiency of convective energy transport is studied for a number of cases. Such perturbations primarily effect the shallow superadiabatic layer of the convective envelope (at depth of approx. 1000 km below the photosphere). Independent of the details of the perturbation scheme, the resulting change in the solar radius is always very small compared to the change in luminosity. This appears to be true for any physical mechanism of solar variability which operates in the outer layers of the convection zone. Changes of the solar radius have been inferred from historical observations of solar eclipses. Considering the constraints on concurrent luminosity changes, this type of solar variability must be indicative of changes in the solar structure at substantial depths below the superadiabatic layer of the convective envelope.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820010239/downloads/19820010239.pdf,/api/citations/19820010239/downloads/19820010239.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19820010273,AERODYNAMICS,Prediction of blade vortex interaction noise from measured blade pressure,"The impulsive nature of noise due to the interaction of a rotor blade with a tip vortex is studied. The time signature of this noise is calculated theoretically based on the measured blade surface pressure fluctuation of an operational load survey rotor in slow descending flight and is compared with the simultaneous microphone measurement. Particularly, the physical understanding of the characteristic features of a waveform is extensively studied in order to understand the generating mechanism and to identify the important parameters. The interaction trajectory of a tip vortex on an acoustic planform is shown to be a very important parameter for the impulsive shape of the noise. The unsteady nature of the pressure distribution at the very leading edge is also important to the pulse shape. The theoretical model using noncompact linear acoustics predicts the general shape of interaction impulse pretty well except for peak amplitude which requires more continuous pressure information along the span at the leading edge.",2013-08-10,1981-01-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The experiment consists of two parts, an electronic box and the magnetic field sensor. The sensor includes three independent measuring flux-gate magnetometers, each measuring one component. The physical background is the nonlinearity of the B-H curve of a ferrite material. Two coils wound around a ferrite rod are necessary. One of them, a tank coil, pumps the ferrite rod at approximately 20 kilohertz. As a consequence of the nonlinearity, many harmonics can be produced. The second coil (i.e., the detection coil) resonates to the first harmonic. If an unknown dc or low-frequency magnetic field exists, the amplitude of the first harmonic is a measure for the unknown magnetic field.

A geometric model with a common discretization for all analyses is employed. It uses improved thermal elements and the results from the thermal analysis directly in the structural analysis without any intervening data processing. The differences between the conventional FE approach as implemented in large programs and an integrated FE approach currently under development are described. Considerations for thermal modeling of truss members is discussed and three thermal truss finite elements are presented. The performance of these elements was evaluated for typical truss members neglecting joint effects. A simple truss with metallic joints and composite members was studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach for realistic truss designs. A study of the effects of aluminum joints on the thermal deformations of a simple, plane truss with composite members showed that joint effects may be significant. Further study is needed to assess the role of joint effects on the deformation of large trusses.",2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010407/downloads/19820010407.pdf,/api/citations/19820010407/downloads/19820010407.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

Linear finite element analysis correlated well with experimental small amplitude vibration data. The buckling and vibration behavior of a pretensional stayed column was studied in detail. The bifurcation buckling load was also predicted accurately. Postbuckling behavior of the column was unusual and results in a post buckling restoring force of only 1/64 the bifurcation buckling load. Interaction between lateral accelerations and compressive load creates isolated stay slackening at loads above 50 percent of the buckling load. Further research will be required to fully understand their impact on the use of pretensioned structures as large space structures.,2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010408/downloads/19820010408.pdf,/api/citations/19820010408/downloads/19820010408.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

In addition, three additional lattice configurations were also constructured along with two beams made of tetrahedrons. The relative frequency variations of the six cantilever truss beams for their first mode were examined. To make the comparison meaningful, the beam length, the number of lattice joints and the total weight were chosen to be identical within 2 percent differences. The frequencies of the four nonperiodic truss beams varied over 60 percent while those of the two beams of tetrahedron lattices only about 13 percent. Such wide frequency variations of the proposed nonperiodic truss beams indicate that the introduction of nonperiodic lattices could be effectively used to improve the controllability of steady state vibration as well as improved wave dispersion characteristics.",2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010410/downloads/19820010410.pdf,/api/citations/19820010410/downloads/19820010410.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

Results with the doped fuel indicated that less than 5% conversion of NH3 to nitrogen oxide levels below Environmental Protection Agency limits could be achieved. In some instances, excessive CO levels were encountered. It is shown that use of a burner design employing a less fuel-rich primary zone than that found optimum for liquid fuels would yield more acceptable CO emissions.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820010816/downloads/19820010816.pdf,/api/citations/19820010816/downloads/19820010816.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The measurements and analyses reveal several severe storm features and insights with respect to storm air flow circulations and inflow-outflow orientation. Precipitation downdraft air is recirculated back into the updraft core below the scud cloud in both back and front feeder type storms. In a back feeder type storm, the downdraft outflow air ahead of the storm is also recirculated back into the updraft region near cloud base.",2013-09-04,1982-02-01,/api/citations/19820010929/downloads/19820010929.pdf,/api/citations/19820010929/downloads/19820010929.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19820011242,ASTRONOMY,Theoretical studies of the RS Canum Venaticorum stars,The activity in RS Canum Venaticorum (CVn) is investigated. Models for chromospheric structure are developed and the role of magnetic fields both in the photosphere as well as in the chromosphere and upper atmosphere are examined. T Tau stars are also studied from the same points of view. The properties of magnetic field loops are used to help understand the atmospheric structure in RS CVn stars. The concepts developed in the case of these stars appear to be applicable over a much broader region of the HR diagram. The absence of stable magnetic loops in the atmospheres of late type giant stars suggests that the atmospheres of RS CVn active components are qualitatively distinct from the solar atmosphere.,2013-09-04,1982-02-23,/api/citations/19820011242/downloads/19820011242.pdf,/api/citations/19820011242/downloads/19820011242.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

At a temperature of 64 K, previous results for charge transfer efficiency (CTE) were reproduced, and a sensitivity of about 2 x 10 to the minus 15th power joules was measured. At 27 and 6 K, extended integration times were achieved, but CTE was substantially degraded. The noise was approximately 6000 charges, which was in excess of the level where statistical fluctuations from the illumination could be detected. A telescope demonstration was performed showing that the array sensitivity and difficulty of operation were not substantially different from laboratory levels. Ways in which the device could be improved for astronomical applications were discussed.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820011243/downloads/19820011243.pdf,/api/citations/19820011243/downloads/19820011243.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The classification algorithm developed from this model exploits the tendency of certain ground-cover classes to occur more frequently in some spatial contexts than in others. A key input to this contextural classifier is a quantitative characterization of this tendency: the context function. Several methods for estimating the context function are explored, and two complementary methods are recommended. The contextural classifier is shown to produce substantial improvements in classification accuracy compared to the accuracy produced by a non-contextural uniform-priors maximum likelihood classifier when these methods of estimating the context function are used. An approximate algorithm, which cuts computational requirements by over one-half, is presented. The search for an optimal implementation is furthered by an exploration of the relative merits of using spectral classes or information classes for classification and/or context function estimation.",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19820014712/downloads/19820014712.pdf,/api/citations/19820014712/downloads/19820014712.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The measured brightness temperatures over bare fields are shown to compare favorably with those calculated from radiative transfer theory with two constant parameters characterizing surface roughness effect. The presence of vegetation cover is found to reduce the sensitivity to soil moisture variation. This sensitivity reduction is generally pronounced the denser, the vegetation cover and the higher the frequency of observation. The effect of vegetation cover is also examined with respect to the measured polarization factor at both frequencies. With the exception of dry corn fields, the measured polarization factor over vegetated fields is found appreciably reduced compared to that over bare fields. A much larger reduction in this factor is found at 5GHz than at 1.4GHz frequency.",2013-09-04,1981-06-01,/api/citations/19820014713/downloads/19820014713.pdf,/api/citations/19820014713/downloads/19820014713.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19820014727,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Heat flux estimates over vegetation derived using radiometric surface temperatures and a boundary layer model in comparison with sodar-derived values,"An attempt was made to validate a method that uses radiometric surface temperatures and a boundary layer model to estimate surface energy budgets and characteristics. Surface temperatures from a hand-held radiometer and sodar data were collected simultaneously on seven days between mid-July and mid-October 1980. The comparison of the RDMS and sodar heat fluxes proved disappointing. Free convection conditions, required to produce sodar-derived heat fluxes, were inhibited by a terrain-induced low level inversion. Only three out of seven cases produced meaningful sodar heat fluxes. Of those three cases, one had good agreement and the other two had sodar heat fluxes 15 to 45 w/sq m lower than the RDMS values. Since the RDMS method is relatively untested, it was impossible to conclusively determine its validity from the results.

Aircraft position is provided by radar and an option exists for including the effects of the aircraft's rigid-body attitude relative to the flight path. Time synchronization between radar and acoustic recording stations permits ensemble averaging techniques to be applied to the acoustic data thereby increasing the statistical accuracy of the acoustic results. Measured layered meteorological data obtained during the flyovers are used to compute propagation effects through the atmosphere. Final results are narrow-band spectra and directivities corrected for the flight environment to an equivalent static condition at a specified radius.,2013-09-04,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820015075/downloads/19820015075.pdf,/api/citations/19820015075/downloads/19820015075.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19820015158,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,Theoretical studies of the electronic structure of small metal clusters,"Theoretical studies of the electronic structure of metal clusters, in particular clusters of Group IIA and IIB atoms were conducted. Early in the project it became clear that electron correlation involving d orbitals plays a more important role in the binding of these clusters than had been previously anticipated. This necessitated that computer codes for calculating two electron integrals and for constructing the resulting CI Hamiltonions be replaced with newer, more efficient procedures. Program modification, interfacing and testing were performed. Results of both plans are reported.",2013-09-04,1982-03-31,/api/citations/19820015158/downloads/19820015158.pdf,/api/citations/19820015158/downloads/19820015158.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19820015227,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,A simple radiation model of cometary dust for P/Halley,"Algebra, parameter values, and results for a model of the radiation from the dust environment of Comet P/Halley are presented. The model includes absorption and single scattering of sunlight and IR emission, for the dust and nucleus. It employs dust particle photometric properties which are independent of wave length, particle size, and position within the coma, separately in the visible and IR regions. Values for these properties are obtained from published photometric data for several comets, and are applied to a numerical model for the dust distribution near Halley. A calculation for a spacecraft 1081 km sunward of Halley's nucleus (at 1.05 AU, postperihelion) leads to omnidirectional, integral flux values of 1235 W/sqm for direct sunlight, 0.24 W/sqm for dust IR emission, 0.095 W/sam for sunlight scattered from the dust, 0.0015 W/sqm for sunlight reflected from the nucleus, and 0.00033 W/sqm for nucleus IR emission.",2013-08-10,1981-11-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The Earth grazed the tail, whose apparent length reached up to 150 deg. The maximum acceleration the ejecta were subjected to by solar radiation pressure is approximately 2.5 times the solar attraction. This acceleration indicates the presence of submicron sized, strongly absorbing particles. Their detectable contribution to the tail's brightness is limited to the immediate proximity of the orbit plane because of a low reflectivity and/or a low spatial density. The width of the tail, observed edgewise at the time of transit, is determined by particles whose beta = 05, possibly submicron sized dielectric grains. Their derived ejection velocity = 450 m/sec.",2013-08-10,1981-11-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The maps are consistent with a simple two-sided relativistic beaming model of the nucleus only if the radio axis is aligned within 10 deg of the line of sight and the flow velocity in the two jets is greater than 0.7c. This implies an unreasonably large physical size for the extended radio emission associated with this galaxy. The most plausible alternative explanation is that both jets are transporting energy to the radio lobes continuously, but that the counterjet is much less efficient at converting a fraction of this energy into radio emission than the brighter jet is.",2013-08-13,1986-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The velocity amplitude of the emission line source is 58 + or - 4 km/s, leading to a mass function of about 0.0015 solar mass and implying a moderately low inclination. The line cores in H-alpha and H-beta lead the wings slightly in orbital phase, contrary to the predictions of simple hot spot models of the line core.

Analysis of the IRAS data shows that the mass-loss rates from RV Tau stars have apparently significantly decreased during the past 500 yr. It seems likely that these stars have just evolved from the phase of rapid mass loss, characteristic of the last stages of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The birthrate of RV Tau stars in the solar neighborhood is about a tenth of the birthrate of all planetary nebulae, and this is consistent with the view that we are witnessing the subset of stars undergoing post-AGB evolution that are low mass and at least in some cases of low metallicity.",2013-08-13,1986-10-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870033337,ASTROPHYSICS,Photoionization in the halo of the Galaxy,"The ionizing radiation field in the halo is calculated and found to be dominated in the 13.6-45 eV range by light from O-B stars that escapes the disk, by planetary nebulae at 45-54 eV, by quasars and the Galactic soft X-ray background at 54-2000 eV, and by the extragalactic X-ray background at higher energies. Photoionization models are calculated with this radiation field incident on halo clouds of constant density for a variety of densities, for normal and depleted abundances, and with variations of the incident spectrum. For species at least triply ionized, such as Si IV, C IV, N V, and O VI, the line ratios are determined by intervening gas with the greatest volume, which is not necessarily the greatest mass component. Column densities from doubly ionized species like Si III should be greater than from triply ionized species.

19870033340,SOLAR PHYSICS,Convection zone origins of solar atmospheric heating,"Spicules are examined as a means for supplying the corona with mass, energy, and magnetic field. It is suggested that spicules form from the supersonic upward expansion of material on nearly evacuated network flux tubes embedded within the sun's convection zone. This allows supersonic but subescape velocities to be attained by the material as it flows outward through the photosphere. Although supersonic, the kinetic energy (subescape) of the spicule material, as observed, is insufficient for coronal heating. It is suggested that, through buoyancy changes on evacuated flux tubes, the magnetic field first 'wicks' material flow into the solar atmosphere. Subsequently, the magnetic field energizes the gaseous material to form the conventional hot, dynamically expanding, solar corona. This occurs through momentum and energy transport by Alfven waves and associated Maxwell stresses concurrently flowing upward on these 'geysers' (spicules). The vertical momentum equation governing fluid flow is examined, and a particular equipartition solution is presented for the flow velocity along a simple field geometry.",2013-08-13,1986-10-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

High-resolution measured spectra of OH airglow have not been reported, and thus it is difficult to assess its impact on moderately-high-resolution earth-limb spectroscopy capable of looking between strong OH lines.

It is shown that, at the same redshifts as the quasars, only galaxy associations of exceptional richness would be identifiable in the existing data. Calculations are performed to assess the probability of pairs of quasars appearing in galaxy associations and it is found that physical pairs could appear with the observed frequency provided that quasars are more common relative to galaxy associations at earlier epochs.",2013-08-13,1986-10-09,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870034099,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,A thermal-capillary mechanism for a growth rate limit in edge-defined film-fed growth of silicon sheets,"Capillarity, acting to set the shape of the melt/gas interfaces, and heat transfer can interact to cause limits to steady-state growth of thin silicon sheets by the Edge-Defined Film-Fed Growth (EFG) method. A finite-element/Newton solution method for a two-dimensional thermal-capillary model of EFG is used to show that limiting values of pull rate exist beyond which steady-state growth is impossible. The pull rate limit is also predicted by a one-dimensional heat transfer model valid when the die sides and menisci are almost parallel and when the thermal conductivities of melt, crystal, and die are all equal. Both the one- and two-dimensional heat transfer models show that heat loss from the melt is dominated by conduction into the crystal and slow heat release to the ambient along the length of the ribbon. The limiting pull rate results from the reduced efficiency of conduction through the melt caused by the curvature of the meniscus which increases height of the die top above the level of the melt. Thermal-capillary limits are predicted for both positive and negative pressure differences across the meniscus.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

This hot corrosion attack reduced room temperature strengths by as much as 50 percent. Strength degradation was proportional to the degree and uniformity of corrosion pitting attack as controlled by the chemistry of the molten salt. Extensive fractography identified corrosion pits as the most prevalent source of failure.

19870034250,SPACECRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Investigation of beamed-energy ERH thruster performance,"The objective of this study was to determine the performance of an External Radiation Heated (ERH) thruster. In this thruster, high intensity laser energy is focused to ignite either a Laser Supported Combustion (LSC) wave or a Laser Supported Detonation (LSD) wave. Thrust is generated as the LSC or LSD wave propagates over the thruster's surface, or in the proposed thruster configuration, the vehicle afterbody. Thrust models for the LSC and LSD waves were developed and simulated on a computer. Performance parameters investigated include the effect of laser intensity, flight Mach number, and altitude on mean-thrust and coupling coefficient of the ERH thruster. Results from these models suggest that the ERH thruster using LSC/LSD wave ignition could provide propulsion performance considerably greater than any propulsion system currently available.",2013-08-13,1986-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870034283,PLASMA PHYSICS,Theory of beat-resonant coupling of electrostatic modes,"A general expression is derived for the beat-resonant coupling electrostatic modes in a Vlasov plasma. The result for the coupling of two modes has a simple structure: the appropriate momentum gradient of the equilibrium particle distribution is weighted by a positive coupling coefficient and averaged over the resonance surface in momentum space. The contributions of all the resonance surfaces are then summed. This basic structure had been previously exhibited only for specific homogeneous plasma models. The present theory, which unifies and greatly simplifies these individual treatments, is based on a variational formulation of the Vlasov-Poisson equations. Using Lie transforms, the variational principle is reexpressed in oscillation-center variables, and then the nonlinear wave dynamics are obtained from the independent variations of the wave phase and the wave amplitude. The power of the method is then applied to a strongly magnetized, strongly inhomogeneous, non-neutral plasma model.",2013-08-13,1986-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

From the first simulation it is found that the magnetosonic-wave energy is transferred to high-energy particles. In the second type of simulation, magnetosonic waves produce a hot surface layer on the plasma that is ablated by the wave energy.

Heat is transferred by direct contact between fine droplets (100 to 300 micron diameter) of a low vapor pressure liquid and an inert working gas. Complete separation of the droplet and gas media in the microgravity environment is accomplished by configuring the LDHX as a vortex chamber. A quasi-one-dimensional, two-phase heat transfer model of the LDHX is developed and used to investigate the potential use of the LDHX for both heating and cooling the working gas in a 100-k W(e) Braytoan cycle. Experimental studies on a small scale LDHX chamber, using air and water as the two media, show excellent agreement with the theoretical model.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870034652,GEOPHYSICS,"A densely spaced array of sea level monitors for the detection of vertical crustal deformation in the Shumagin seismic gap, Alaska","A network of sea level gauges has been installed with about 40 km spacing in the Shumagin Islands in order to detect relative vertical motion, in particular, possible crustal motion precursory to an expected major earthquake. This required the development and deployment of a pressure sensor sea level gauge suitable for installation on remote and harsh coastlines. Data are collected in near-real-time via satellite, both in order to exploit fully any precursors that may be observed and to provide continuous information on the status of the instruments. Using Wiener filtering techniques, it has been determined conservatively that no relative vertical crustal motion greater than 0.1 m between stations has occurred during 1981-1985. This is consistent with independent geodetic leveling and trilateration data, though evidence exists for more rapid deformation during 1978-1980. The sea level data collected so far have an rms noise level of about 0.04 m after processing; this is limited in part by the pressure sensor and associated electronics. Improved prressure gauges with better long-term stability have recently been installed. A short-baseline tiltmeter operating in a tunnel has demonstrated that suitably designed and located land-based tiltmeters have a lower noise level, and hence better precursor detection characteristics than the sea level gauges, at monthly and shorter periods.",2013-08-13,1986-08-10,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870034654,GEOPHYSICS,Continuous measurement of nontidal variations of gravity,"Records from seven superconducting gravimeters operated at five different locations in California and one in Boulder, CO, are examined after removal of tides and the gravitational attraction of the atmosphere. Fluctuations over periods between a few days and several months were observed at all sites with peak amplitudes of order 10 microgal. By contrast, a 640-day record obtained with one of the instruments in Germany showed peak fluctuations of only 2 microgal. In most of the records the causes of these aperiodic variations were not determined so that they serve to set limits on the vertical motion or displacement of mass at the respective locations. However, at The Geysers geothermal field, much of the gravity variation is correlated with seismic activity, reinjection rate, and rainfall. Measurements of this type were not possible prior to the development of the superconducting device. Consequently, these results provide the first evidence for the existence of gravity variations on the time scale and of the magnitude described here. Vertical crustal motion, motion related to seismic events, and hydrological phenomena can lead to variations on this scale. Unambiguous identification of causal relationships will require either special circumstances such as found at The Geysers or operation of the instruments in pairs.",2013-08-13,1986-08-10,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Comparison of present predictions with observations obtained from Pioneer Venus, Arecibo, and Venera data support a picture of regional pyroclastic deposits being very rare, magma contents not usually exceeding about 4 wt pct, and the atmospheric pressure having been about the same as the present value over a time period equivalent to the average age of the northern areas of the northern hemisphere. Data suggest that numerous eruptions had effusion rates exceeding common terrestrial rates, and that shield volcanoes are often wide, but are low relative to those on Mars and earth. Implications of the proposed Venusian reduction of the driving density contrast include dike intrusion being very common, and large minimum magma volumes being required to ensure surface eruptions.",2013-08-13,1986-08-10,,,CDMS,OTHER,

This method uses different grid points than previously used pseudospectral methods: in fact the grid points are related to the zeroes of the Legendre polynomials. The main advantage of this method is that the allowable time step is proportional to the inverse of the number of grid points 1/N rather than to 1/n(2) (as in the case of other pseudospectral methods applied to mixed initial boundary value problems).

The methods have application to the models of the atmospheres of Venus, earth, and Mars. The narrow-band methods include a general random model and techniques employing the Malkmus (1967) line-strength distribution, and the accuracy of these models at low pressure is found to be sensitive to the line-strength distribution and the line shape. When combined with a simple Voigt parameterization, the more efficient approximate methods represented by an exponential wideband model are found to be almost as accurate as the expensive narrow-band models.

The quasars have a mean power law energy slope which in five individual cases is inconsistent with the value found in hard X-ray selection criterion rather than luminosity, redshift, or U-B color. New IUE and optical continuum spectra and infrared photometry are presented for these quasars. The data are combined into log vf(v) and log v distributions which support the decomposition of the overall quasar spectrum into a power law plus a superposed optical-UV 'big bump' which may be due to an accretion disk.

A bias-free method of slope estimation is developed that takes into account the exact error distribution, the influence of background noise, and the effects of varying limiting sensitivities. It is shown that the resulting bias corrections are quite insensitive to the bias correction procedures applied, as long as only sources with signal-to-noise ratio five or greater are considered. However, if sources with signal-to-noise ratio five or less are included, the derived bias corrections depend sensitively on the shape of the error distribution.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) has conducted a program to examine, with the aid of high-speed computer codes, how the trajectories of particles contribute to the ice accumulation on airfoils and engine inlets. For this effort, a computer code was developed to calculate icing particle trajectories and impingement limits for axisymmetric inlets.

ICE magnetic field and plasma measurements show a well-defined cometary magnetotail composed of two magnetic lobes in pressure equilibrium with a central plasma sheet. A dependence of ion tail width on IMF direction is found which strongly suggests that the classical type I ion tails observed on the ground consist predominantly of emissions from the slab-shaped plasma sheet separating the magnetic lobes. The width of the G-Z magnetotail is determined to be 9.8 (+ or - 0.5) x 10 to the 3rd km with a quasi-circular cross section. The results of this study also indicate that some of the dynamical thinnings and thickenings observed in long type I tails may be caused by IMF variations changing the angle with which the plasma sheet is viewed at earth.,2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

High correlations were found for all projected baselines, with little or no tendency to decrease even for the longest baselines. For incoherent radiation, the correlation as a function of the baseline is the Fourier transform of the source brightness distribution, implying an average source region diameter for all of the bursts analyzed of less than about 10 km. For such small source diameters, the required growth rates are too large to be explained by existing incoherent theories, strongly indicating that the radiation must be coherent. For coherent radiation, an upper limit to the source region diameter can be inferred instead from the angular width of the radiation pattern. The angular width of the radiation pattern must be at least 2.5 deg, implying that the diameter of the source must be less than about 20 km.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is argued that the interpretation of the 'atmospheric holes' in terms of such an influx is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the lunar seismic network set up during the Apollo project did not detect such an influx. Frank et al. reply that this discrepancy may be traced to the insensitivity of the lunar seismic stations for the detection of the impacts of tenuous, weakly bound comets relative to those of dense, stony meteoroids.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870036258,GEOPHYSICS,The morphology of Antarctic total ozone as seen by TOMS,"A more detailed examination of the TOMS observations reveals a number of important aspects of the Antarctic ozone depletion. First, it is noted that the presence of large scale disturbances around the edge of the ozone hole can lead to highly variable station observations. Second, an examination of the zonal mean total ozone for the seven Octobers shows that the large systematic decline is not simply confined to the polar region but exists at midlatitudes as well. Integrations of the total ozone from the South Pole northwards show that a portion of the systematic trend of decreasing Antarctic total ozone (prior to 1985) seems to be due to a redistribution of total ozone to subpolar and midlatitude regions. That is, decreases at high latitudes are compensated by increases at lower latitudes. The correlation between zonal mean total ozone and 70 mb zonal mean temperatures from polar to midlatitudes shows that the systematic decreases in total ozone is well correlated with a systematic decrease in stratospheric temperatures.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The change in zonally averaged temperatures during that period is almost the same for each year. However, there is substantial interannual variability in the time evolution of the warming as events of enhanced wave, mean-flow interaction associated with bursts of upward propagating planetary waves develop at different times in different years. Polar temperatures in the middle stratosphere can increase as much as about 20 K in 4 days during these events.

Analysis of the single station data that exhibit the most pronounced minima suggest that the spatial structure of the global minimum is different from the currently observed reduction. Very low north polar values were observed, but there is no indication of anomalously low ozone in Antarctica. The temporal relationship to the sun spot cycle is similar in both time periods. Rather than solar terrestrial interaction, however, a more likely explanation of the early 1960's reduction is normal climatology caused by a persistent period of planetary wave activity. Such a natural explanation may also be appropriate for the current depletion.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870036267,GEOPHYSICS,Polar stratospheric clouds inferred from satellite data,"Anomalously high radiances from the ozone channel of the Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) sounding instrument have been observed in the Northern Hemisphere winter lower stratosphere. Such events, thought to be due to polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), are examined further by computing relative humidities using Stratospheric Sounding Unit temperatures and water vapor measurements from the LIMS Map Archive Tape analyses. Regions identified as PSCs are found to correspond closely to regions of high humidity. While instances of saturation were found, the average humidity at the centers of 39 PSCs was calculated to be 58 percent. Possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy are discussed. Applying a similar approach to the Southern Hemisphere, in 1979, virtually no PSCs are found in the vortex after September 10 at 20 km.

Maximum spring CZCS chlorophyll concentrations occurred during April when the water column was not thermally stratified and were spatially and temporally associated with reductions in wind speed both in onshelf and in offshelf regions. Increased chlorophyll concentrations in offshelf waters were associated with high wind speeds during May when a deep chlorophyll maximum was present. Chlorophyll patchiness was observed on length scales typical of those controlled by biological processes during the April low-wind period but not during March or May when wind speeds were greater. The spring CZCS chlorophyll maximum in the southern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Bight occurred in response to a reduction in mixed layer depth caused by decreased wind speeds and not by increased water column stratification.,2013-08-13,1986-11-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The chosen mechanical and electrochemical conditions resulted in predominantly transgranular, cleavage-like failure at high (about 8 to 50 microns/s) average crack propagation rates. Crack arrest markings were observed on selected transgranular facets, which almost exclusively bordered regions of ductile overload failure.

Initial investigations have been performed at modest thermal gradients in the liquid, G(L) less than 60 C/cm and over a range of furnace (solidification) velocities, V = 0.8 45.4 cm/h. The primary dendrite spacing for near eutectic Sm2Co17/Co scaled with 1/sq rt V and varied from about 50 microns for V greater than or equal to 20 cm/h to hundreds of microns for V less than 10 cm/h, while the rod eutectic diameter and interrod spacing were an order of magnitude smaller. For both dendritic and cooperative growth, the associated permanent magnet properties were rather poor, e.g., remanence less than 4 kG and coercive force less than 1 kOe for the smallest dendrite and rod diameter dimensions encountered, although the magnetic hardness for the rod eutetic was larger than for the dendritic microstructure.

Analytic forms for the wind temperature profile are derived, and spectral solutions obtained by considering a modified, time-independent Kompaneets equation are presented subject to a variety of initial conditions. A probabilistic formalism which describes the effect of diffusion photons travelling beyond the trapping radius is developed to allow the calculation of spectra observed at infinity.

Interaction with the surrounding medium has a major effect on the X-ray surface brightness distribution at large radii, at least for galaxies in clusters. The data do not warrant the general assumptions of isothermality and gravitational hydrostatic equilibrium at large radii. Comparison of the X-ray surface brightness profiles with model predictions indicate that 1/r-squared halos with masses of the order of 10 times the stellar masses are required to match the data.

One probe with adequate angular resolution to study the near zone is VLBI observation of the SiO masers. It is shown that VLBI maps of VX Sgr establish that the particle density in the SiO masers is very high (about 10 to the 12th/cu cm), indicating that the masers form in dense cloudlets and not in a spherically expanding wind.

Also, the use of high-resolution limb profiles allows for atmospheric modeling independent of gravitational hydrostatic equilibrium. The chromospheric model is constructed to match high-resolution solar limb profiles at 30, 50, 100, and 200 microns, determined by an occultation of the solar limb observed from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory during the total solar eclipse of July 31, 1981.

For a sample of 94 GMCs associated with high-luminosity radio H II regions, the efficiency of OB star formation decreases significantly with increasing cloud mass over the observed mass range. It is concluded that star formation is generally not stimulated by an internal mechanism. The formation of OB stars by cloud-cloud collisions is suggested by the observed quadratic dependence of the Galactic H II region distribution on the local density of H2.

Ingots that were furnace cooled at the same rate but without stirring were compared with the rheocast ingots. Rheocasting yielded fine-grained structures, where the extent of microsegregation, the variation in macrostructure, and the solidification-induced porosity and ingot cracking were found to be reduced in comparison to the unstirred ingots. The grain size and nonuniformity were reduced by increasing the stirring speed, isothermal stirring time, or the volume fraction solid during stirring; decreased microsegregation was achieved by an increase in the volume fraction solid. The structures of grain boundaries lent support to the grain boundary mechanism proposed by Vogel et al. (1977) for rheocasting.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Prealloyed vacuum induction melted ingots were argon-atomized, the powders were cooled to room temperature, and various powder-size fractions were examined by optical metallography. Linear correlations were obtained for the powder size dependence of the secondary dendrite arm spacing, following the expected d-alpha (R) to the m power dependence on the particle size for all four superalloy compositions. However, the Ni-20 pct Cr alloy, which had much coarser arm spacing as compared to the other three alloys, had a much larger value of m.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870036906,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Sporadic narrowband radio emissions from Uranus,"Among several different types of radio emissions discovered at Uranus during the Voyager 2 encounter in January 1986 is a very sporadic, bursty signal which consists of very narrow bands lying in the frequency range from about 3 to 10 kHz. The bursty emission was virtually undetectable from the dayside portion of the Voyager 2 trajectory, but was observed out to beyond 300 R(U) during the outbound trajectory through the predawn sector. While the narrowband tones making up this emission are reminiscent of escaping continuum radiation observed near earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, the Uranian signals show large amplitude variations on time scales of 1 s, suggesting a very different type of generation mechanism.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The energy-loss function for rotational excitation and deexcitation of H2O by electron impact is calculated theoretically. The rotational cooling rate is calculated using this loss function for a wide range of electron and neutral temperatures. The vibrational cooling rate is calculated using measured values of electron-impact vibrational excitation cross sections. Analytical formulas are provided for some of the cooling rates.

The novae are Sgr 1982, Mus 1983, FH Ser (1970) and HR Del (1967), of which the latter two were also detected by IRAS. Mus 1983 is noted to have IR emission characteristics that are consistent with a free-free spectrum, as opposed to dust emission.

19870037476,AEROSPACE MEDICINE,Dexamethasone mimicks the antimotion sickness effects of amphetamine and scopolamine,"Based on preliminary suggestions that individual differences in susceptibility to stressful motion might be related to physiological differences in responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the efficacy of dexamethasone and metyrapone is tested in subjects exposed to cross-coupled accelerative semicircular canal stimulation on a rotating chair. Subjects given 0.5 mg of dexamethasone every 6 h for 48 h could endure 80 percent more stressful motion (P = 0.03) in a within-subjects design study, whereas, no improvement followed treatment with 750 mg of metryapone every 4 h for 24 h. The efficacy of dexamethasone might be explained in terms of its neurochemical actions on several neurotransmitter systems which are also modulated by such classical antimotion sickness drugs as amphetamine and scopolamine. Because dexamethasone induces adaptive changes within the central nervous system it may prove superior to scopolamine and amphetamine which possess significant side effects, are short acting, and rapidly tolerated.",2013-08-13,1986-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870037505,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Analysis of the dynamics of African vegetation using the normalized difference vegetation index,"Images at a resolution of 8 km are currently being generated for the whole of Africa, displaying the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These images have undergone a process of temporal compositing to reduce the effects of cloud cover and atmospheric variation. When the NDVI is plotted against time, different cover types are shown to have characteristic profiles corresponding closely with their phenology. The resultant pattern of NDVI values displayed on the images is analyzed in terms of the cover types present and local variations in rainfall. Comparison between images for 1983 and 1984 overall showed considerable similarities, but significant differences were observed in the northward extent of the greening wave in the Sahel, the greening up of the Kalahari Desert and East African communities. It is concluded that vegetation monitoring using NDVI images needs to be associated with scene stratification according to cover type.",2013-08-13,1986-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The technique is described in detail, and results for five different approximations of the He target state are presented in a table. Good convergence is obtained, but it is found that even the best calculated value of the resonance is about 130 meV higher than the experimentally measured value of 19.367 + or - 0.007 eV (Brunt et al., 1977), a discrepancy attributed to the contribution of the shift in the Feshbach formalism.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The number of configurations available for the CRP system is limitless, thus only a small portion of the number of possible cases were examined. Measurements were made upstream, in between and downstream of the propeller system. The abundance of data readily available from the LDV system clearly identifies the tip vortices and wake regions. The recovery by the downstream propeller of the swirl velocity imparted to the flow by the upstream propeller is very evident. The coefficients of thrust and power were determined using momentum and energy analysis of the data and compared to theory.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870037631,"AIRCRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",A heater made from graphite composite material for potential deicing application,"A surface heater was developed using a graphite fiber-epoxy composite as the heating element. This heater can be thin, highly electrically and thermally conductive, and can conform to an irregular surface. Therefore it may be used in an aircraft's thermal deicing system to quickly and uniformly heat the aircraft surface. One-ply of unidirectional graphite fiber-epoxy composite was laminated between two plies of fiber glass-epoxy composite, with nickel foil contacting the end portions of the composite and partly exposed beyond the composites for electrical contact. The model heater used brominated P-100 fibers from Amoco. The fiber's electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and density were 50 micro ohms per centimenter, 270 W/m-K and 2.30 gm/cubic cm, respectively. The electricity was found to penetrate through the composite in the transverse direction to make an acceptably low foil-composite contact resistance. When conducting current, the heater temperature increase reached 50 percent of the steady state value within 20 sec. There was no overheating at the ends of the heater provided there was no water corrosion. If the foil-composite bonding failed during storage, liquid water exposure was found to oxidize the foil. Such bonding failure may be avoided if perforated nickel foil is used, so that the composite plies can bond to each other through the perforated holes and therefore lock the foil in place.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Measurements of density, temperature, and velocity were conducted with the calibrated, nonintrusive, optical technique for two different combustor operating conditions. First, measurements were made in the supersonic flow over a rearward-facing step without transverse injection for comparison with calculated pressure profiles.

The region is one in which temperature increases from 25,000 K to about 1 million K and the matter density, fed by the outward flowing wind and the inward streaming plasma, increases by a factor of 40. The morphology of the region is described, along with the theoretical models being applied to the observed nonthermal line broadening, Doppler wavelength shifts, temporal fluctuations, and fine structure. Deficiencies in existing simple models of the region are discussed.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870039537,ASTROPHYSICS,Variability of Markarian 1018 - Seyfert 1.9 to Seyfert 1,"Simultaneous IUE and optical spectrophotometry of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy Markarian 1018 is presented. The strength of H-beta(broad) has increased by a factor of 6.6 in 4 yr, and the galaxy now shows strong broad UV and optical line emission similar to that seen in normal Seyfert 1 galaxies, but with markedly asymmetric line profiles. As in other variable Seyfert galaxies, H-alpha emission has also increased but by a lesser amount than H-beta. Furthermore, Ly-alpha (not observed during the first epoch) is now quite strong relative to H-beta and H-alpha. Inspection of the line profiles reveals nearly identical blue asymmetric line profiles in all permitted lines; these show evidence of significant profile evolution over a 1 yr time scale. The present line ratios and the nature of their variability suggest that the enhancement in the broad-line emission is not caused by the removal of obscuring dust but by the 'lighting up' of the broad-line region.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870039540,ASTROPHYSICS,Effect of intervening galaxies on quasar counts and colors,"Ostriker and Heisler (1984) suggested that optically thick dust in galaxies could reduce the number of high-redshift quasars without reddening the observed quasars, because the only observed quasars would be those seen through no intervening galaxies. However, Ostriker and Heisler assumed that galaxies were hard-edged uniform disks, and the fuzzy edges of real galaxies significantly change this conclusion. The quasar distribution observed through more realistic galaxy models is calculated, and it is found that dust cannot significantly reduce the high-redshift quasar counts without also reddening the observed sample. But this reddening could be consistent with past studies of quasar reddening; improved studies of quasar reddening using new UV and IR data are needed.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The geometry of the X-ray emitting region, the energetic efficiency of the accretion in the disk and in the boundary layer which leads to a relation between the disk and the boundary layer luminosities, and the irradiation of the disk by the boundary layer are studied. The model of the radiation spectrum emerging from the neutron star and the innermost part of the disk is presented. The relativistic and Doppler effects and their influence on the spectrum as a function of inclination angle are discussed.

The observations show this object to be bipolar, with the blueshifted lobe having extraordinarily low excitation. Infrared observations of the exciting star show it to be of very low luminosity, with a bolometric luminosity of 0.88 solar luminosity. The visual extinction indicates a highly nonspherical distribution of circumstellar dust around the exciting star.

The early atmosphere would apparently have been stable against the onset of a runaway greenhouse (that is, the complete evaporation of the oceans) for carbon dioxide pressures up to at least 100 bars. A 10- to 20-bar carbon dioxide atmosphere, such as may have existed during the first several hundred million years of the earth's history, would have had a surface temperature of approximately 85 to 110 C. The early stratosphere should have been dry, thereby precluding the possibility of an oxygenic prebiotic atmosphere caused by photodissociation of water vapor followed by escape of hydrogen to space. Earth's present atmosphere also appears to be stable against a carbon dioxide-induced runaway greenhouse.",2013-08-13,1986-12-12,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Contrary to a plausible initial idea, the continuum amplitudes are not organized by position of the observer relative to the dense plasma sheet. Instead, there seem to be preferred orientations of system III longitude with respect to the direction to the sun which account for the peaks. This implies a clock-like modulation of the continuum radiation intensity as opposed to a searchlight effect. The importance of the dipole longitude-solar wind alignment to the amplitude of the continuum radiation implies the source region of the radiation is near the magnetopause and may indirectly tie the generation of the radio waves to the clocklike modulation of energetic electron fluxes from Jupiter.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

A range of different Si and SiC substrates were examined to isolate the factors critical to pitting.

Throughout the entire composition range the Nd2Fe14B-type tetragonal crystal structure is maintained, with the lattice constants decreasing significantly as the Co concentration x increases.

According to the disposition of the electron-dense projections attached to the adjoining membranes these contacts were classified as symmetrical or asymmetrical. The axon profiles contained aggregations of clear vesicles randomly distributed or grouped in clusters adjacent to the electron-dense projections. Dense core vesicles were occasionally seen. The neuroglial profiles were either astrocytic or ependymoglial in nature. The astrocytes showed a clear cytoplasm, polymorphous vesicles, mitochondria, glycogen granules, and bundles of filaments. The ependymal cells, in contrast, had a more electron-dense and granular appearance, tubular structures, irregular vesicular formations, profiles of smooth reticuloendoplasm, and filaments grouped in bundles or isolated in the cytoplasm.

The heart rate, rectal temperature, and nondominant wrist activity were monitored in 12 male subjects during 6 days of normal routine at home and during 6 days of controlled bed-rest regimen. The comparisons of averaged waveforms for the activity, heart rate, and temperature indicated that about 45 percent of the range of the circadian heart rate rhythm during normal routine and about 14 percent of the range of the circadian temperature rhythm were attributable to the effects of activity. The smaller effect of activity on the temperature rhythm may be partially attributable to the fact that core temperature is being more rigorously conserved than heart rate, at least during moderate exercise.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870040082,ASTROPHYSICS,Similarity considerations and conservation laws for magneto-static atmospheres,"The equations of magnetohydrostatic equilibria for a plasma in a gravitational field are investigated analytically. For equilibria with one ignorable spatial coordinate, the equations reduce to a single nonlinear elliptic equation for the magnetic potential. Similarity solutions of the elliptic equation are obtained for the case of an isothermal atmosphere in a uniform gravitational field. The solutions are obtained from a consideration of the invariance group of the elliptic equation. The importance of symmetries of the elliptic equation also appears in the determination of conservation laws. It turns out that the elliptic equation can be written as a variational principle, and the symmetries of the variational functional lead (via Noether's theorem) to conservation laws for the equation. As an example of the application of the similarity solutions, a model magnetostatic atmosphere is constructed in which the current density J is proportional to the cube of the magnetic potential, and falls off exponentially with distance vertical to the base, with an 'e-folding' distance equal to the gravitational scale height. The solutions show the interplay between the gravitational force, the J x B force (B, magnetic field induction) and the gas pressure gradient.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The technique is used to reconstruct the trajectory of an actual type III burst and the results are compared to the trajectory obtained from the global density law method.

Dust particles that are larger than 1 micron, when injected into the Solar System from comets and asteroids, will spiral into the sun due to the Poynting-Robertson effect. During the process of spiraling in, such dust particles accumulate solar flare tracks. The accumulated track density for a given dust grain is a function of the duration of its space exposure and its distance from the sun. Using a computer model, it was determined that the expected track density distributions from grains produced by comets are very different from those produced by asteroids. Individual asteroids produce populations of particles that arrive at 1 AU with scaled track density distributions containing 'spikes,' while comets supply particles with a flatter and wider distribution of track densities.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Both 3 and 5 min umbral oscillations were detected at photospheric heights. The 5 min oscillations have reduced amplitude in the umbra, which appears to act as a filter in transmitting selected frequencies in the power spectrum of 5 min p-mode oscillations of the surrounding convection zone. The k-omicron power spectrum of the umbral oscillations shows this selective transmission and also shows a shift of power to longer horizontal wavelengths. This behavior is exhibited by a simple theoretical model of the interaction of p-modes with a sunspot. The 3 min umbral oscillations are concentrated in the dark central part of the umbra. In both sunspots, the kinetic energy density of the 3 min umbral oscillation in the photosphere is much greater than the corresponding kinetic energy density at chromospheric heights measured in other sunspots.",2013-08-13,1986-12-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The vertical distribution of H2O was derived for the 1-6 bar portion of Jupiter's troposphere. The spatial variation of H2O was measured using IRIS spectra of the Hot Spots in the North and South Equatorial Belts (NEB, SEB) and the Equatorial Zone and for an average of the North and South Tropical Zones. The H2O column abundance above the 4 bar level is the same in the zones as in the SEB Hot Spots, about 20 cm amagats. The NEB Hot Spots are desiccated by a factor of 3 with respect to the rest of Jupiter. For an average between -40 and +40 deg latitude, the H2O mole fraction, qH2O, is saturated for P less than 2 bars, qH2O = 4 millionths in the 2-4 bar range, and it increases to 3/100,000 at 6 bars. A similar vertical profile applies to the spatially resolved zone and belt spectra, except that H2O falls off more rapidly at P less than 4 bars in the NEB Hot Spots. A massive H2O cloud at 5 bars, T = 273 K is inconsistent with the observations. Instead, a thin H2O ice cloud would form at 2 bars, T = 200 K.

The complexity of the flow in this type of channel is demonstrated by such phenomena as flow impingement on the walls, separation at the bend corners, flow reattachment, and flow recirculation. Because of the strong nonisotropic nature of the turbulent flow in the channel, the full Reynolds-stress model was employed for the evaluation of turbulence quantities. Computations are made for several different corrugation periods and for different Reynolds numbers. The results computed by using the present model show excellent agreement with experimental data for mean velocities, the Reynolds stresses, and average Nusselt numbers. The study was further extended to a channel flow where fins are inserted at bends in the channel.

It is shown that the effect of flow oscillations will be to reduce the channel heat transfer coefficient. This effect is due to the fact that the heat addition along the channel wall produces an increasing fluid temperature along the channel length. The flow oscillations interacting with this positive temperature gradient will induce a heat flow back toward the channel inlet. This will tend to inhibit the heat transfer process and will raise the wall temperature required to transfer away a given amount of heat at the channel wall.,2013-08-13,1987-02-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Neither landing site is representative of the nearby highlands of Aphrodite, but the Vega 2 landing site is similar to much of the northern plains of Venus.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870040646,GEOPHYSICS,The onset of time-dependent convection in spherical shells as a clue to chaotic convection in the earth's mantle,"This work presents a detailed numerical study of the dynamical behavior of convection in a spherical shell, as applied to mantle convection. From both two-dimensional (120 radial and 360 tangential points) and three-dimensional (60 radial levels and spherical harmonics up to order and degree L = 33, m = 33), it is shown that for a spherical shell (with inner-to-outer radii ratio eta = 0.62) convection becomes time-dependent, with l = 2 dominating, at a Rayleigh number of about 31 times supercritical for a constant-viscosity, base-heated configuration. This secondary instability is characterized by oscillatory time dependence, with higher frequencies involved, at slightly higher Rayleigh numbers. In illustrating the onset of time dependence, the analysis is extended to show that the onset of weak turbulence in spherical-shell convection takes place at about 60 times the critical Rayleigh number via a quasi-periodic mode.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870040649,GEOPHYSICS,Steady surficial core motions - An alternate method,"A new method for deriving steady surficial core motions from geomagnetic field models is presented and applied. The original method determines the steady velocity field at the top of a frozen-flux core which best fits, in both the spatial and temporal linear least squares sense, a model of the large scale geomagnetic secular variation (SV) at the base of a source-free mantle (Voorhies, 1986). New method is based upon the same physical assumptions, but fits SV at earth's surface instead of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The newly derived flow differs somewhat from prior solutions, and shows but slight westward drift; however, other key global properties are virtually unchanged. Over a 15 year interval the new method provides a better fit to the time-varying geomagnetic field at earth's surface than does the old.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The majority of holes are found near cloud edges, but the larger holes tend to be found in cloud interiors. Aircraft measurements show these cloud spatial inhomogeneities in the range of 100 to 500 m, while Landsat data show them in the range of 100 m to 3 km. The number of holes per cloud decreases exponentially with increasing hole diameter. Small clouds not only have smaller holes, but also fewer holes than large clouds. Large clouds have large holes in them, as well as large numbers of the smaller holes. The total cloud area occupied by holes increases with increasing cloud size.",2013-08-13,1986-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870040755,ASTROPHYSICS,Radio structure in the inner 1 arcsecond of NGC 1068,"High-resolution VLA and VLBI observations of NGC 1068 at several different wavelengths are reported. These observations provide new information about the triple radio source in the central arcsec (75 pc) of the galaxy. The 21-cm European VLBI Network observations at 0.05-arcsec resolution detect a core of flux density 89 + or - 10 mJy. This core is dominated by a component less than 20 marcsec (1.5 pc) in diameter that has a brightness temperature of about 10 to the 8th K. Two more components may have been detected by the VLBI observations, one on either side of the compact core. At 0.07-arcsec resolution, the 1.3-cm VLA map of the central arcsec of NGC 1068 reveals a C-shaped radio morphology on scales from 10 to 50 pc. A comparison of the relative locations of the three components in the VLA and VLBI maps shows that the compact core in the VLBI map probably should be identified with the central component in the 1.3- and 2-cm VLA maps. If this identification is correct, the central component in the VLA maps is the actual nucleus of the galaxy. The core of the inner triple radio source may contain a significant flat-spectrum component. The presence of a compact core and the evidence for bending strengthen the argument that the inner triple radio source is produced by a mechanism similar to that operating in powerful radio galaxies. For a minimum-energy configuration, magnetic-field strengths of about 1 mG and energy densities of about 100 nerg/cu cm are found for the components of this source.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870040774,ASTROPHYSICS,Circumstances for Pluto-Charon mutual events in 1987,"Circumstances are tabulated for 88 Pluto-Charon mutual events occurring during the 1987 opposition.

The duration of these total events is predicted to be from 32 to 79 min. The mutual-event season is now expected to conclude during the 1990 opposition. Two new stars have been selected as comparison stars for events occurring prior to opposition in 1987. Standardization of the primary comparison stars used in 1985 and 1986 has yielded the following magnitudes: B = 12.6044 + or - 0.0015 and V = 11.7956 + or - 0.0017 (1985 Primary); B = 13.1238 + or 0.0008 and V = 12.3885 + or - 0.0014 (1986 Primary).",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Forces and moments were measured on a large ogive-cylinder store in the presence of a 45 deg swept-wing-fuselage bomber configuration for a number of store locations below the fuselage center line.  Results of the investigation show that large variations of store lift, drag, and pitch occur with changes in store or airplane angle of attack, store vertical location, and store horizontal location. The variation of the store forces and moments with respect to the chordwise location of the wing plan form indicates that the wing is a large factor in producing the interference loads on the store. Comparison of data for underfuselage and underwing store locations at an angle of attack of 0 deg showed maximum store drag interferences of similar magnitudes, but showed considerably smaller maximum interference on store lift an pitching moments for underfuselage store locations.",2013-08-02,1957-01-14,/api/citations/19650003116/downloads/19650003116.pdf,/api/citations/19650003116/downloads/19650003116.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

All three systems show random fluctuations in velocity well above their measurement errors. The point-by-point velocities are used to determine the diagnostic statistical parameter, the structure function. The random motions show correlation with spatial separation, as expected for turbulence; but comparison with the predictions of classical theory for nebular turbulence shows poor agreement.

Due to anharmonicity, the emission from the upper vibrational levels is shifted to longer wavelengths from that of the v = 1-0 transition. It is shown that structure in the 3-micron region is readily and quantitatively explained by emission from upper vibrational levels of excited PAHs that contain a maximum of 20-30 carbon atoms. The asymmetrical broadening of the 11.3-micron emission band may also be due to anharmonicity.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Thus, the temperatures of formation of the Al III lines could be determined by using one of the line ratios in two quiet sun regions, a coronal hole, and an active region. The results were found to be consistent with expectations based on the assumption of ionization equilibrium for Al III.

Several bursts with relatively simple pulse structure and sufficient intensity have been analyzed for evidence of spectral variability on time scales shorter than the pulse durations. In many of these bursts pulse structures are found, ranging in duration from 1 to 10 seconds, which exhibit a trend of hard-to-soft spectral evolution. No significant evidence for soft-to-hard evolution has been found. The HXRBS data above 100 keV and the GRS data above 1 MeV indicate that the spectral evolution generally is not due to time-varying absorption features at energies below 100 keV.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870051566,INSTRUMENTATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY,Wave-measurement capabilities of the surface contour radar and the airborne oceanographic lidar,The 36-gigahertz surface contour radar and the airborne oceanographic lidar were used in the SIR-B underflight mission off the coast of Chile in October 1984. The two systems and some of their wave-measurement capabilities are described. The surface contour radar can determine the directional wave spectrum and eliminate the 180-degree ambiguity in wave propagation direction that is inherent in some other techniques such as stereophotography and the radar ocean wave spectrometer. The Airborne Oceanographic Lidar can acquire profile data on the waves and produce a spectrum that is close to the nondirectional ocean-wave spectrum for ground tracks parallel to the wave propagation direction.,2013-08-13,1987-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870051961,GEOPHYSICS,Numerical modeling of proton and electron bursts in a realistic magnetotail,"Particle trajectories of the magnetotail ion and electron bursts were simulated using the Beard-Hirschi-Propp (1982) magnetic field model and data generated by IMP 8. Particle trajectories were computed both in the absence of the electric field, and with electric field introduced locally perpendicular to the magnetic field. The results indicate that the motions of energetic particles near the nominal neutral sheet can be divided into two types. Proton and electron parallel trajectories have most of their trajectory motion parallel to the magnetic field lines and travel long distances along field lines. Perpendicular particle trajectories travel much shorter distances with much of the trajectory motion perpendicular to the magnetic field and with proton trajectories interacting with the neutral sheet region. Only the premidnight trajectories connect to reasonable source locations, which explains the preferential occurrence of earthward energetic proton burst anisotropies in the premidnight sector.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The optical spectrum of the galaxy exhibits no nuclear activity, and its radio emission is consistent with early-type galaxy status.

EF Eri is shown to behave almost exactly as predicted by simple theory, with its soft X-ray luminosity not exceeding the hard X-ray luminosity by more than a factor of three, and both spectra originating from the same active pole of the accreting white dwarf. The data are consistent with a model involving an accretion stream penetrating deep into the magnetosphere of the white dwarf, such that accretion occurs along nonpolar field lines, and an 'X-ray auroral oval' emission is formed on the surface of the white dwarf.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870052108,METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Development of a two-dimensional zonally averaged statistical-dynamical model. I - The parameterization of moist convection and its role in the general circulation,"The moist convection parameterization used in the GISS 3-D GCM is adapted for use in a two-dimensional (2-D) zonally averaged statistical-dynamical model. Experiments with different versions of the parameterization show that its impact on the general circulation in the 2-D model does not parallel its impact in the 3-D model unless the effect of zonal variations is parameterized in the moist convection calculations. A parameterization of the variations in moist static energy is introduced in which the temperature variations are calculated from baroclinic stability theory, and the relative humidity is assumed to be constant. Inclusion of the zonal variations of moist static energy in the 2-D moist convection parameterization allows just a fraction of a latitude circle to be unstable and enhances the amount of deep convection. This leads to a 2-D simulation of the general circulation very similar to that in the 3-D model. The experiments show that the general circulation is sensitive to the parameterized amount of deep convection in the subsident branch of the Hadley cell. The more there is, the weaker are the Hadley cell circulations and the westerly jets. The experiments also confirm the effects of momentum mixing associated with moist convection found by earlier investigators and, in addition, show that the momentum mixing weakens the Ferrel cell. An experiment in which the moist convection was removed while the hydrological cycle was retained and the eddy forcing was held fixed shows that moist convection by itself stabilizes the tropics, reduces the Hadley circulation, and reduces the maximum speeds in the westerly jets.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

This has been accomplished using as predictor the dispersion (measured by the average correlation) between members of an ensemble of forecasts started from five different analyses. The analyses had been previously derived for satellite-data-impact studies and included, in the Northern Hemisphere, moderate perturbations associated with the use of different observing systems. When the Northern Hemisphere was used as a verification region, the prediction of skill was rather poor. This is due to the fact that such a large area usually contains regions with excellent forecasts as well as regions with poor forecasts, and does not allow for discrimination between them. However, when regional verifications were used, the ensemble forecast dispersion provided a very good prediction of the quality of the individual forecasts.",2013-08-13,1987-02-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870052240,METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Tropical and extratropical forcing of the large-scale circulation - A diagnostic study,"Seasonal anomalies in the large-scale circulation are studied in relation to seasonal-mean tropical forcing and extratropical transient-eddy forcing using nine years of tropical-wind and outgoing-longwave-radiation (OLR) data. Results show that in the interannual time scale, extreme swings in anomalous convection over the maritime continent of Indonesia/Borneo and the equatorial central Pacific are linked, respectively, by an east-west seesaw or a dipole pattern, identified with major fluctuations of the Pacific Walker circulation. It is found that extratropical circulation anomalies are related to the fluctuation of this dipole heat source. The overall extratropical circulation seems to be more responsive to the dipole heating with enhanced convection over the maritime continent. While the characteristics of the transient eddies, especially near the exit region of the East Asia jet stream, change substantially between maximum or minimum convection episodes, these transient eddies (defined as transients from the seasonal mean) appear to be unimportant in forcing the seasonal mean circulation anomalies.",2013-08-13,1987-02-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

In particular, H chondrites classified as heavily shocked petrologically do not necessarily exhibit Ar-40 loss and vice versa. The clear-cut causal relationship between siderophile and mobile element loss with increasing late shock seen in L chondrites is not generally evident in the H group. H chondrite parent material experienced an early high temperature genetic episode that mobilized a substantial proportion of these trace elements so that later thermal episodes resulted in more subtle, collateral fractionations. Mildly shocked L chondrites escaped this early high temperature event, indicating that the two most numerous meteorite groups differ fundamentally in genetic history.",2013-08-13,1987-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Emission lines from high-temperature transition regions and chromospheres analogous to those observed in the solar spectrum were observed. The only visible component of II Peg and both components of V711 Tau and AR Lac appear to be chromospherically active. For the latter systems, the Mg II line surface flux from the G-type star is higher than that from the K subgiant, which dominates the observed UV line flux. Moreover, evidence of long-term ultraviolet variability is presented for AR Lac. The emission line fluxes for II Peg and, marginally, for the other two systems were observed to vary in antiphase with the optical variations at the time of the IUE observations. By comparing the results of Rodono et al.

The local curvature hypothesis, making possible formulation of the theory in terms of a line integral, is expanded to include the possibilities of local cylindricity, local biaxial ellipsoidal hyperbolicity, and least-squares local sphericity.

The probes were mounted in such a position that for certain Orbiter orientations, the wake edge formed by the starboard payload bay sill swept across the probes at a roll rate of once per orbit about an inertially stabilized pointing direction. Profiles of O(+) number density and electron number density across the wake edge showed that the charge particle number densities declined into the wake at a faster rate than that predicted by theoretical models. At angles of more than 10 deg into the wake from its geometric edge, two electron populations are found, with different mean random energies and electrical potentials. One of these populations is suggested to be the result of selective filtering of the high energy tails of the ambient ionospheric population, the other, a result of photoemission from the payload bay surfaces.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Embedded in the large-scale region 1 system are small-scale intense currents that are not necessarily aligned in the east-west geomagnetic direction. The major carriers of the large-scale region 1 Birkeland currents appear to be upward-flowing electrons with energies below 10 eV. Embedded within this flux can be spatially limited regions of 'hotter' electron fluxes that carry small-scale currents. The correlation of magnetic and particle observations obtained here supports previous suggestions that the region 1 currents in the morning sector have their source in the boundary layer and that the region 2 currents are associated with the plasma sheet.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

During the 65-s impulsive phase the gamma rays above 10 MeV contain emissions from both primary electron bremsstrahlung and nuclear pion decay. Hence the impulsive phase acceleration process must produce both primary electrons with energies above 60 MeV and ions above 500 MeV. This flare also has a extended emission phase lasting more than 1000 s which is most easily observed at gamma-ray energies above 10 MeV. After removing the counting rates from the more slowly moving neutrons produced at earlier times, the resulting gamma ray spectrum can be entirely explained by nuclear pion production. Over 70 percent of the pions were produced in the extended emission phase. In contrast, more than 70 percent of the high-energy primary electron bremsstrahlung and the nuclear line emission produced by ions below 30 MeV occurred in the 65-s impulsive phase.

19870053739,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,"The effects of pin elasticity, clearance, and friction on the stresses in a pin-loaded orthotropic plate","The effects of pin elasticity, clearance, and friction on the stresses in a pin loaded orthotropic plate are studied. The effects are studied by posing the problem as a planar contact elasticity problem, the pin and the plate being two elastic bodies which interact through contact. Coulomb friction is assumed, the pin loads the plate in one of its principal material directions, and the plate is infinite in extent. A collocation scheme and interaction, in conjunction with a complex variable series solution, are used to obtain numerical results. The contact region between the plate and pin is unknown and must be solved for as part of the solution. The same is true of the region of friction induced no slip. Two pin stiffnesses, two clearance levels, two friction levels and two laminates, a (0/+ or - 45/90)s and a (02/+ or - 45)s, are studied. The effects of pin elasticity, clearance, and friction on the load capacity of the plate are assessed by comparing the load capacity of the plate with the capacity when the pin is rigid, perfectly fitting, and frictionless.",2013-08-13,1987-03-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870053804,NONMETALLIC MATERIALS,Effects of milling brominated P-100 graphite fibers,"Preliminary procedures have been developed for the ball milling of pristine and brominated P-100 graphite fibers. Because of the lubricative properties of graphite, large ball loads (50 percent by volume) are required. Use of 2-propanol as a milling medium enhances the efficiency of the process. The fibers, when allowed to settle from the milling medium, tend to be preferentially aligned with rather few fibers standing up. Milled, brominated P-100 fibers have resistivities that are indistinguishable from their pristine counterparts, apparently because of loss of bromine. This suggests that bromine would not be the intercalate of choice in applications where milled fibers of this type are required. It was found that brominated graphite fibers are stable in a wide variety of organic solvents.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870053828,SPACECRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Experimental study of low Reynolds number nozzles,"High-performance electrothermal thrusters operate in a low nozzle-throat Reynolds number regime. Under these conditions, the flow boundary layer occupies a large volume inside the nozzle, contributing to large viscous losses. Four nozzles (conical, bell, trumpet, and modified trumpet) and a sharp-edged orifice were evaluated over a Reynolds number range of 500 to 9000 with unheated nitrogen and hydrogen. The nozzles showed significant decreases in specific impulse efficiency with decreasing Reynolds number. At Reynolds numbers less than 1000, all four nozzles were probably filled with a large boundary layer. The discharge coefficient decreased with Reynolds number in the same manner as the specific impulse efficiency. The bell and modified trumpet nozzles had discharge coefficients 4 to 8 percent higher than those of the cone or trumpet nozzles. The Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) nozzle analysis computer program was used to predict nozzle performance. The results were then compared to the experimental results in order to determine the accuracy of the program within this flow regime.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Ion engine operation at a nominal 4.0 ampere beam current and 30.0 volt discharge gives a specific impulse of 3310 sec, a total engine efficiency of 64.3 percent, and a thrust-to-power ratio of 39.5 mN/kW at an input power level of 5.10 kW. These modified J series ion engines are shown to be capable of throttling over an 8:1 range from a power level of 5.48 kW at 3285 sec to a power level of 0.70 kW at 1856 sec.

19870053853,SPACECRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Arcjet component conditions through a multistart test,"A low power, dc arcjet thruster was tested for starting reliability using hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures simulating the decomposition products of hydrazine. More than 300 starts were accumulated in phases with extended burn-in periods interlaced. A high degree of flow stabilization was built into the arcjet and the power supply incorporated both rapid current regulation and a high voltage, pulsed starting circuit. A nominal current level of 10 A was maintained throughout the test. Photomicrographs of the cathode tip showed a rapid recession to a steady-state operating geometry. A target of 300 starts was selected, as this represents significantly more than anticipated (150 to 240), in missions of 10 yr or less duration. Weighings showed no apparent mass loss. Some anode erosion was observed, particularly at the entrance to the constrictor. This was attributed to the brief period during startup the arc mode attachment point spends in the high pressure region upstream of the nozzle. Based on the results obtained, startup does not appear to be performance or life limiting for the number of starts typical of operational satellite applications.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

For the plant tissues, the data reveal that mung bean sprouts contain homoglutathione and no glutathione; alfalfa sprouts contain homoglutathione and glutathione; the pea seed, nonlegumes, and fungi contain glutathione and no homoglutathione.

19870053882,AIRCRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,A parametric study of a gas-generator airturbo ramjet (ATR),"Parametric engine performance calculations were carried out for an airturbo ramjet (ATR). A LOX-LH2 rocket powered turbine powered the compressor. The engine was flown over a typical flight path up to Mach 5 to show the effect of engine off design operation. The compressor design efficiency, compressor pressure ratio, rocket turbine efficiency, rocket turbine inlet temperature, and rocket chamber pressure were varied to show their effect on engine net thrust and specific impulse at Mach 5 cruise. Estimates of engine weights as a function of the ratio of compressor air to rocket propellant flow and rocket chamber pressure are also included. In general, the Mach 5 results indicate that increasing the amount of rocket gas produced increased thrust but decreased the specific impulse. The engine performance was fairly sensitive to rocket chamber pressure, especially at higher compressor pressure ratios. At higher compressor pressure ratios, the engine thrust was sensitive to turbine inlet temperature. At all compressor pressure ratios, the engine performance was not sensitive to compressor or turbine efficiency.",2013-08-13,1986-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Correlation of the losses shows a weak dependence on the Weber number and a slightly stronger dependence on the saturated liquid-to-vapor density ratio.

19870053907,PLASMA PHYSICS,A comparative study of plasma heating by ion acoustic and modified two-stream instabilities at subcritical quasi-perpendicular shocks,"Plasma heating due to the ion acoustic instability and the modified two-stream instability is examined for quasi-perpendicular subcritical shocks. Electron and ion heating is investigated as a function of upstream electron to ion temperature ratio and plasma beta using second-order heating rates. A simple shock model is employed in which the cross-field electron-ion drift speed is adjusted until the total (adiabatic plus anomalous) heating matches that required by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Quantities such as the width of the shock and the maximum electric field fluctuations are also calculated, and the results are compared with the ISEE data set of subcritical bow shock crossings. The observed width of the shock, the amount of plasma heating, and the low-frequency electric field intensity are in reasonably good agreement with the calculations for the modified two-stream instability. On the other hand, the wave intensities at higher frequency are about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted for the ion acoustic instability at saturation, consistent with the fact that the measured shock widths imply cross-field drift speeds that are below threshold for this instability. It is therefore concluded that the dissipation at these shocks is most likely due to the lowest frequency, modified two-stream instability.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870053918,GEOPHYSICS,A possible energy source to power stable auroral red arcs - Precipitating electrons,"Results of coincident measurements by ground-based photometers and the low-altitude plasma instrument on board the Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite are presented that demonstrate the association of precipitating low-energy electrons with stable auroral red (SAR) arcs. A search of available data has yielded 23 instances of DE 2 overflights during the presence of SAR arcs being monitored by the photometers. For each case, downward fluxes of electrons are found to be enhanced along field lines penetrating the arcs in relation to regions both north and south of the features. Modeling of the atmospheric response to these influxes indicates that these electrons can represent a major source of the energy required to establish temperature profiles within the ionospheric electron gas that are sufficient to produce the recorded 6300-A emission rates. The sensitivity of these results to uncertainties of the assumed spacecraft potential and thermospheric composition has been investigated and found to be important, but does not alter the conclusion that precipitating electrons are a fundamental link in the production of SAR arcs.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

A variational principle which minimizes the free energy predicts the relaxed state. Exact, two-dimensional solutions of the relaxed state are obtained. A universal feature of the exact solutions is a chain of magnetic islands along the tail axis.

These findings constitute unambiguous evidence that the N contained in these strata is the end result of biogeochemical processes that differed substantially from those that operated on the N contained in intervening organic carbon-poor strata and younger marine sediments. The data indicate that the low N-15 relative abundance is the consequence of pelagic rather than postdepositional processes. Reduced ocean circulation, increased denitrification, and hence, reduced euphotic zone nitrate availability may have led to Cretaceous phytoplankton assemblages that were periodically dominated by N2-fixing blue-green algae, a possible source of the sedimentary N-15 depletion.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Equations are derived for the coupled evolution of random velocities and spins, showing that friction and surface irregularity both reduce the local velocity dispersion and transfer significant amounts of random kinetic energy to rotational energy. Results for the equilibrium ratio of rotational energy to random kinetic energy are exact not only for identical nongravitating mass points, but also if finite size, self-gravitating forces, or size distribution are included. The model is applied to the dynamics of Saturn's rings, showing that the inclusion of rotation reduces the geometrical thickness of the layer of cm-sized particles to, at most, about one-half, with large particles being less affected.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

After each release, the data show the formation of a structured diamagnetic cavity. The cavity grows until the dynamic pressure of the expanding ions balances the magnetic pressure on its surface. The magnetic field inside the cavity is zero. The barium ions collect on the surface of the cavity, producing a shell. Plasma irregularities form along magnetic field lines draped over the surface of the cavity. The scale size of the irregularities is nearly equal to the thickness of the shell. The evolution and structuring of the diamagnetic cavity are modeled using magnetohydrodynamics theory.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870056467,GEOPHYSICS,The ionosphere as a fully adequate source of plasma for the earth's magnetosphere,"The ionospheric contribution of the polar wind and cleft ion fountain at energies less than 10 eV has been added to previously measured sources; this total ion outflow has then been used to calculate the resulting ion density in the different internal regions of the earth's magnetosphere: plasmasphere, plasma trough, plasma sheet, and magnetotail lobes. Using estimated volumes for these regions and an ion residence time characteristic of each region, it is found that the observed magnetospheric densities can be attained in all cases with no contribution from the solar wind plasma. In the case of the plasma sheet the ionospherically supplied density is more than enough to match the observations and even suggests an invisible component of low-energy plasma (less than 10 eV) which has never been observed. A detailed comparison between the calculated ionospheric source effects in the plasma sheet and those recently measured by ISEE shows excellent agreement and suggests a direct polar low-energy ion source for the plasma sheet which has remained unmeasured because of spacecraft potential effects. Although the solar wind is clearly the earth's magnetospheric energy source and energetic solar wind ions are observed in the magnetosphere, these calculations suggest the possibility that the ionospheric source alone is sufficient to supply the entire magnetospheric plasma content under all geomagnetic conditions.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870056564,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,A simple and efficient shear-flexible plate bending element,"A shear-flexible triangular element formulation, which utilizes an assumed quadratic displacement potential energy approach and is numerically integrated using Gauss quadrature, is presented. The Reissner/Mindlin hypothesis of constant cross-sectional warping is directly applied to the three-dimensional elasticity theory to obtain a moderately thick-plate theory or constant shear-angle theory (CST), wherein the middle surface is no longer considered to be the reference surface and the two rotations are replaced by the two in-plane displacements as nodal variables. The resulting finite-element possesses 18 degrees of freedom (DOF). Numerical results are obtained for two different numerical integration schemes and a wide range of meshes and span-to-thickness ratios. These, when compared with available exact, series or finite-element solutions, demonstrate accuracy and rapid convergence characteristics of the present element. This is especially true in the case of thin to very thin plates, when the present element, used in conjunction with the reduced integration scheme, outperforms its counterpart, based on discrete Kirchhoff constraint theory (DKT).",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

I - Basic theory,A theory for the origin of intraseasonal oscillations of the tropical atmosphere is presented. The theoretical background for and main features of the intraseasonal variability of the tropical atmosphere are discussed. The theory is validated for the 40-50 day oscillation using a simple model. The transient response of the tropical atmosphere to a local oscillating heat source and an internally forced heat source is studied. The structure and mechanism of the eastward propagation are examined. It is noted that the eastward propagation of low-frequency oscillation is the result of the interaction between convection and dynamics via the mobile wave-CISK mechanism. It is suggested that the low-frequency oscillations are an intrinisic atmospheric phenomena that exist without a dynamically interactive ocean.,2013-08-13,1987-03-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870056799,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Roadside tree attenuation measurements at UHF for land mobile satellite systems,"Tree attenuation results at 870 MHz are described for experiments conducted in October 1985 and March 1986 in Central Maryland. These experiments employed a helicopter as a source platform and a van with receiver and data acquisition instrumentation. Tree attenuation results were obtained for the cases in which the van was stationary and in motion. The experiments were performed for the purpose of providing the designers of planned land mobile satellite systems with important elements in the determination of link parameter requirements; namely, the expected fading statistics due to roadside trees for both mobile and stationary vehicles. Single tree attenuation results gave worst case median fades as high as 15 dB although roadside tree values were noted to produce fades in excess of 20 dB for small percentages of time. The cumulative fade distributions and their relative contributions as a function of path elevation angle, right side versus left side driving, and different road types are derived from the field measurements. Upon comparing the attenuations from bare deciduous trees (March 1986) with those due to trees in full foliage (October 1985), the increase in dB attenuations were, in general, less than 25 percent for the dynamic cases, and less than 40 percent for the worst case static configuration. This result demonstrates that the dominant fading is caused by the wooded tree branches as opposed to the leaves on these branches. The tail end of the observed fade distributions was observed to follow lognormal distributions with respect to dB attenuation.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The edges of grains beome worn and shed comminuted debris, which collects on weathered surfaces and grains alike. The resulting transfer of material from loose grains to bedrock surfaces (and vice versa) could yield misleading results on rock composition; moreover, the generation of comminuted debris would enhance chemical reactions that could affect the composition of the atmosphere. The results are thus relevant in assessing rates of surface degradation, the evolution of small-scale surface features as seen in images returned from the Soviet Venera missions, and in the interpretation of compositional data for surface materials.",2013-08-13,1987-05-28,,,CDMS,OTHER,

This indicates that during maximum light a lower-temperature region, but necessarily larger surface area, than during minimum light is seen. This suggests a nonspherically symmetric star, which is oblate with respect to the magnetic axis and which is cooler at the magnetic poles than at the magnetic equator. The light variations of such nonspherically symmetric oblique rotator models have been studied. It is found that, for an oblate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of 0.92 and a temperature difference of about 1000 K between the poles and the equator, the overall variations of the optical and the ultraviolet energy distributions can be well understood.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

There are two major results: (1) the elemental abundances for nine of the outer regions are remarkably similar to those previously measured in the core. This result implies the spectra of the cores and halos of giant H II regions (subject to the different ionizing radiation fields) are analyzed correctly by the standard methods. Hence measurements of extragalactic H II regions with poor spatial resolution correctly represent the abundances of the whole nebula. The O/H ratio in 30 Dor, by number, is 0.30 solar. The Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O, and Cl/O are close to solar. The gas-phase Fe/O is about 0.2 solar, which probably implies that most of the iron is within solid grains. The He/H is 0.0810 as shown by each of the three strong lines available. One region is cool and rich in helium and all other heavy elements except nitrogen. The spectrum of the region does not resemble that of a supernova remnant in that the forbidden O I and S II lines are not nearly strong enough. The abundances can be explained fairly well as over 10 solar masses of H-poor material ejected during the evolution of a single massive (about 80 solar masses) star during its late O-star and Wolf-Rayet phases.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The maximum FIR emission is coincident, within the uncertainties, with the visual and NIR maxima, identified as the galactic nucleus. It is estimated that the IR luminosity of the 1-kpc-diameter central region in NGC 4449 is comparable to that for a similar-sized region at the center of the Galaxy.

19870057178,ASTROPHYSICS,Polarization of light scattered from the winds of early-type stars,There is evidence from visible wavelength polarimetry that the matter in the winds of early-type stars is not distributed uniformly about the stars. In this paper equations for the observable polarization from an axisymmetric distribution of electrons are derived first from the basic point source model of Brown and McLean (1977) and then from extended atmosphere radiative transfer theory. A factor is derived which corrects the Brown and McLean model for the finite size of stars. This finite disk factor is found to reduce the magnitude of the predicted polarization to less than half of the point source prediction. The effects of having the mass outflow concentrated in a plume are considered. The effects of absorption in an unocculted plume are shown to give rise to a wavelength-dependent polarization that is described using a 'polarization color' parameter. A continuum opacity index is defined that allows for a straightforward interpretation of the polarization of stars of differing effective temperatures.,2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The rate of interaction is proportional to an integral involving the eigenfunctions of the interacting modes, which usually are known only numerically. An approximation in which the eigenfunctions are strictly sinusoidal functions of a suitably defined radial variable, and the numerical details of stellar structure are banished to a coefficient in the integrand, are here explored. The physical assumptions are the same as in the asymptotic approximation of p- or g-modes. This method should allow a general investigation as to likely nonlinear interactions and which modes may participate in such interactions. The coupling of two p-modes by possible large-scale internal magnetic fields is introduced as an anisotropic pressure response to a displacement. Pairs of modes differing in frequency by less than the fraction magnetic/thermal pressure are strongly coupled, and energy appears to oscillate slowly between the two associated spherical harmonics. Potentially, upper limits may be derived for internal magnetic fields.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Ten electronic states, each with 14 vibrational states, were used in the calculations. These new calculations differ from earlier work in terms of additional electronic levels and the role of singlet-triplet transitions between the b and X levels. Since transition moments are not known, calculations are made of observable flux ratios for an array of possible values. Comparison with existing observations indicates that the a-X transition is very important, and there is marginal indication that the b-X transition is present.

The nuclear region of the Lyman-alpha companion to the quasar is resolved with a FWHM of about 0.9 arcsec A magnitude fainter. Limits on detectable continuum flux from this object suggest that it is a gas cloud interacting with the quasar, and its emission is consistent with simple photoionization by the quasar. However, the presence of several galaxies around the periphery of the quasar is noted. A search of 11 additional quasars at z greater than 3 has failed to show any other such systems. It is argued that this is consistent with the statistics of extended emission line systems in low-z quasars.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870057207,ASTROPHYSICS,Effect of an electron scattering cloud on X-ray oscillations produced by beaming,"The effect of a scattering cloud on the amplitude of oscillations produced by a rotating beam of X-rays is investigated using analytical and Monte Carlo methods. The scattering cloud was modeled as a uniform density sphere, and the source was represented as an anistropic distribution of radiation emerging from a point at the center of the scattering cloud. The intensity distribution produced by the source beam is examined as a function of optical depth. The relation between electron scattering optical depth and the forward-backward ratio is studied. It is observed that the scattering in a central corona of various optical depths reduces the amplitude of the oscillation. The data suggest that the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray intensities of some luminous low-mass X-ray binaries are caused by oscillations in the luminosity of the X-ray star.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Attention is given to those arrays that appear capable of fabrication and orbital deployment by the year 2005, and to the tradeoff involved between synthetic aperture concepts that furnish high angular resolution and those that yield sensitivity for faint, extended source imaging.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

To investigate the possible application of these materials as diffusion barriers for the Au-GaAs system, vacuum annealings are made in the temperature range from 200 to 800 C. Resistivity change, X-ray diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy measurements are performed to find the chemical and metallurgical stabilities of these materials in this system. The reaction temperature for Ta(x)Cu(1-x) in contact with GaAs lies between 500 and 700 C. For Au in contact with Ta(x)Cu(1-x) the reaction occurs at about 600 C. Amorphous Ta(93)Cu(7) shows different interdiffusion characteristics with surrounding elements than does Ta(80)Cu(20).",2013-08-13,1987-06-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

These preliminary results show that good quality III-IV epilayers can be grown on Si.

In addition to the advantages of an instrumental full width at half-maximum intensity of only 5.4 km/s, the small thermal width of the heavy oxygen ion also allows determination of accurate line widths and velocities. The CCD spectra were numerically fitted to Gaussian line profiles and revealed two separate velocity systems in NGC 6523. The data sets of radial velocities were used to derive the dependence of the most probable turbulent velocities upon the sample sizes, and the spatial dependence of the structure function. These relationships are the basic functions for comparison with the predictions of the models for turbulence in H II regions.",2013-08-13,1987-06-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The data are presented in extensive tables and graphs and characterized in detail. The radial surface brightness profiles are shown to be steeper than predicted by an idealized spherically symmetric steady-state comet model, the steepness increasing with the projected distance from the nucleus. These profiles are attributed, on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, to imperfect coupling between the sublimated gas and the optically dominant grains of the coma.",2013-08-13,1987-06-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The development of a high-fidelity motion drive controller using an optimal control approach based on human vestibular models is described. The formulation and implementation of the optimal washout system are discussed. The effectiveness of the motion washout system was evaluated by studying the response of six motion washout systems to the NASA/AMES Vertical Motion Simulator for a single dash-quick-stop maneuver. The effects of the motion washout system on pilot performance and simulator acceptability are examined. The data reveal that human spatial orientation models are useful for the design and evaluation of flight simulator motion fidelity.,2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870057515,ASTROPHYSICS,"Elemental abundance analyses with coadded DAO spectrograms. I - The field horizontal-branch stars HD-64488, 109995 and 161817","It is possible to improve the quality of elemental-abundance analyses by using higher-S/N data than has been the practice at high resolution. The procedures developed at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory to coadd high-dispersion coude spectrograms are used with a minimum of 10 6.5-A/mm IIa-O spectrograms of each of three field hoorizontal-branch (FHB) A stars to increase the S/N of the photographic data over a considerable wavelength region. Fine analyses of the sharp-lined prototype FHB stars HD 109995 and 161817 show an internal consistency which justifies this effort. Their photospheric elemental abundances are similar to those of Population II globular cluster giants. As their photometric and spectrophotometric properties are similar to blue HB stars in such clusters, they are confirmed to be the brighter analogs of such stars. HD 64488, which is photometrically and spectrophotometrically similar to the FHB stars, is found to be metal-poor (Fe/H = -1) with much broader lines (v sin i = 147 km/s). The implications of the abundance anomalies of all three stars are discussed.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870057557,INSTRUMENTATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY,"A pulsed electron-photon fluorescence diagnostic technique for temperature and specie concentration measurement at points in relatively dense, unseedded air flows","An analysis is presented on the use of the fluorescence stimulated by combined pulsed electron and photon beams for the study of gas flows up to densities equivalent to an altitude of about 20 km (number density of about 3 x 10 to the 18th/cu cm). The electron beam acts as a pump, requiring no seed gas, to provide a localized concentration of ions or excited state neutrals that can be probed by saturation optical pulses. A short pulse (10ns) electron beam can be used by itself to provide effectively quench-free emission up to number densities of around 10 to the 18th/cm, but is is difficult to maintain satisfactory spatial resolution at this high density. The use of a nearly simultaneous strong optical pulse increases the flexibility of the diagnostic technique, permitting use at densities greater than 10 to the 18th/cu cm with good spatial resolution. The use of flash X-ray sources combined with optical probing also appears promising for densities above 10 to the 19th/cu cm.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870057562,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,Thermal-stress-free fasteners for joining orthotropic materials,"Hot structures fabricated from orthotropic materials are an attractive design option for future high speed vehicles. Joining subassemblies of these materials with standard cylindrical fasteners can lead to loose joints or highly stressed joints due to thermal stress. A method has been developed to eliminate thermal stress and maintain a tight joint by shaping the fastener and mating hole. This method allows both materials (fastener and structure), with different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE's) in each of the three principal material directions, to expand freely with temperature yet remain in contact. For the assumptions made in the analysis, the joint will remain snug, yet free of thermal stress at any temperature. Finite element analysis was used to verify several thermal-stress-free fasteners and to show that conical fasteners, which are thermal-stress-free for isotropic materials, can reduce thermal stresses for transversely isotropic materials compared to a cylindrical fastener. Equations for thermal-stress-free shapes are presented and typical fastener shapes are shown.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Approximately 6 K of the ring flux appears to be due to scattered planetary emission, implying an about 13-K intrinsic thermal component. In conjunction with Voyager radio occultation data on ring particle size distributions, these results are judged to be in keeping with a water ice primary composition for the ring particles.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

When the full annular aperture of a grazing incidence telescope is stopped down, the point spread function becomes highly elliptical with a width as much as sin theta times narrower than the full image.

19870061226,MECHANICAL ENGINEERING,The role of near-surface plastic deformation in the wear of lamellar solids,"It is shown in this paper that the role of surface and near-surface plastic deformation is especially significant in both sliding and abrasive wear of lamellar composites. Lamellar structures were produced artificially from alternate layers of pure copper and pure tin or lead foils. The resulting composites were tested in three different wear tests: single-pass abrasion by a sharp, hard abrader; multiple-pass rubbing by a hard, rounded abrader; and pin-on-disk sliding. In each case the counterface was a hard alloy steel. Tests were run with the composite lamellae in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the sliding direction. It was found that the composites had much less wear resistance and greater abradability when oriented perpendicular to the rub direction. The mechanisms for wear particle removal and the role of plastic deformation in the process were studied by plasticity analysis and by microscopic (SEM and optical) observation.",2013-08-13,1985-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Arcjet operation in different facilities was also compared to determine the validity of tests in small facilities. Volt-ampere characteristics were determined for an arcjet using hydrogen/nitrogen mixtures (simulating both ammonia and hydrazine), hydrogen/nitrogen/ammonia mixtures, and pure ammonia as propellants at various flow rates. The arcjet had a typical performance of 450 sec specific impulse at 1 kW with hydrogen/nitrogen mixtures. It was determined that the amount of ammonia present in the gas stream had a significant effect on the arcjet volt-ampere characteristics. Also, hydrogen/nitrogen mixtures simulating ammonia gave arc characteristics approximately the same as those of pure ammonia. Finally, no differences in arc volt-ampere characteristics were seen between low and high ambient pressure operation in the same facility. A 3 to 5 V difference was seen when different facilities were compared, but this difference was probably due to differences in the voltage drops across the current connections, and not due to arcjet operational differences in the two facilities.",2013-08-13,1986-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The XIPS consists of a 25-cm-diameter laboratory-model thruster, a breadboard-model power supply, and a flight-prototype pressure regulator (the critical component of the pressure-regulated xenon feed system). With a thrust of 63.5 mN, specific impulse of 2800 sec, and thruster efficiency of 65 percent, the XIPS performance is believed to be the highest ever reported for an ion thruster operated at 1.3-kW input power. The XIPS power supply accepts an input power of about 1.4 kW from a 28- to 35-V bus and converts it into the seven outputs required for startup and operation of the thruster. The simplified power supply contains only about 500 parts and has demonstrated an unprecedented efficiency of 90 percent and a specific mass of about 8 kg/kW. The results of a highly successful wear-mechanism test in which the working-model XIPS was operated for 4350 hours and 3850 ON/OFF cycles are presented.

A diameter of six feet for the frames was chosen to reduce specimen fabrication costs and to facilitate testing. Accelerometer, strain gage, and photographic measurements are presented which characterize the impact behavior of frames with differing masses to represent structural or seat/occupant masses.

The SCARE code is presently coupled as a postprocessor to the MSC/NASTRAN general purpose, finite element analysis program. The improved version now includes the Weibull and Batdorf statistical failure theories for both surface and volume flaw based reliability analysis. The program uses the two-parameter Weibull fracture strength cumulative failure probability distribution model with the principle of independent action for poly-axial stress states, and Batdorf's shear-sensitive as well as shear-insensitive statistical theories. The shear-sensitive surface crack configurations include the Griffith crack and Griffith notch geometries, using the total critical coplanar strain energy release rate criterion to predict mixed-mode fracture. Weibull material parameters based on both surface and volume flaw induced fracture can also be calculated from modulus of rupture bar tests, using the least squares method with known specimen geometry and grouped fracture data. The statistical fast fracture theories for surface flaw induced failure, along with selected input and output formats and options, are summarized.

19870061487,AIR TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY,Evaluation of icing drag coefficient correlations applied to iced propeller performance prediction,"Evaluation of three empirical icing drag coefficient correlations is accomplished through application to a set of propeller icing data. The various correlations represent the best means currently available for relating drag rise to various flight and atmospheric conditions for both fixed-wing and rotating airfoils, and the work presented here ilustrates and evaluates one such application of the latter case. The origins of each of the correlations are discussed, and their apparent capabilities and limitations are summarized. These correlations have been made to be an integral part of a computer code, ICEPERF, which has been designed to calculate iced propeller performance. Comparison with experimental propeller icing data shows generally good agreement, with the quality of the predicted results seen to be directly related to the radial icing extent of each case. The code's capability to properly predict thrust coefficient, power coefficient, and propeller efficiency is shown to be strongly dependent on the choice of correlation selected, as well as upon proper specificatioon of radial icing extent.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The results were compared with a previously developed Mach number scaling theory. Three- and four-bladed rotor configurations were found to show very good agreement with the Mach number to the sixth power law for all conditions tested. A reduction of conditions for which BVI blade slap is detected was observed for three-bladed rotors when compared to the two-bladed baseline. The advance ratio boundaries of the four-bladed rotor exhibited an angular dependence not present for the two-bladed configuration.

19870061681,AERODYNAMICS,Finite state modelling of unsteady aerodynamics and its application to a rotor dynamic problem,"The paper presents a method for formulating finite state unsteady aerodynamic models in the time domain from frequency domain unsteady aerodynamics. The method is based on recognizing that the lift deficiency function represents an aerodynamic transfer function and utilizes the Bode plot technique, used in control systems engineering, to construct approximation to the lift deficiency function. Indicial response functions for both fixed wing and rotary wing applications are obtained, using these finite state unsteady aerodynamic models. It is shown that the rotary wing indicial response function is oscillatory and thus it is fundamentally different when compared to the fixed wing indicial response function which is nonoscillatory. Certain aspects of the finite state aerodynamic model are demonstrated by applying it to the flapping dynamics of an articulated helicopter rotor blade. The influence of unsteady aerodynamics on the damping characteristics of the rotor is examined. The same problem is also treated by using a different unsteady aerodynamic model, namely dynamic inflow. Based on a comparison of the results obtained with these two unsteady aerodynamic models, useful conclusions are drawn regarding some fundamental features of these theories.",2013-08-13,1985-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Fractographic analysis of material failing in dynamic fatigue revealed the presence of slow crack growth (SCG) at stressing rates below 6 ksi/min. This material can sustain a 40-ksi flexural stress at 1000 C for 400 h or more but is susceptible to both SCG and creep deformation at higher stress levels. The crack velocity exponent (N) determined both from dynamic and static fatigue experiments lies in a range from 13 to 22. The subcritical crack growth and creep behavior at 1000 C is primarily controlled by the deformation of an intergranular glassy phase.,2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Since it is generally accepted that RNA molecules preceded double-stranded DNA molecules as genetic material, the encapsulation of polyribonucleotides within liposomes (made from dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine) was studied. Quantitative determinations show that approximately 50 percent of the available lipids form liposomes, and that up to 5 percent of the polyribonucleotides can be entrapped by them. Also studied was the encapsulation of polyribonucleotides in the presence of urea and cyanamide and of Zn(2+) and Pb(2+).",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The spark discharge (which is a good source of HCN) and UV light are also important. Reasonable prebiotic syntheses were worked out for the amino acids that occur in proteins (with the exception of lysine, arginine, and histidine), and for purines, pyrimidines, sugars, and nicotinic acid.

The Euler code was seen to be adequate only in predicting primary flow structures (leading edge vortex and cross flow shock) whereas the Navier-Stokes code was capable of predicting secondary flow structures (i.e., secondary vortex). A comparison of laminar and turbulent Navier-Stokes solutions indicated that the turbulent boundary layer model is more accurate in predicting the effect of the boundary layer model on the flowfield. Also, the Navier-Stokes code indicated detailed flow structures not observed in the qualitative experimental data available (i.e., vapor screen photographs) indicating a need for quantitative flow field data.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

One of the most important of these parameters is Reynolds number. The current report compares, for tangent-ogive forebodies with fineness ratios of 3.5, flow patterns from oil-flow photographs to features in pressure distributions. The pressure data base is then used to illustrate the development of the sectional side force coefficient along both the tangent-ogive nose and an attached cylindrical afterbody for Reynolds numbers of 0.2, 0.8 and 3.8 million, based on maximum diameter, and angles of attack of 40, 50 and 60 deg.

19870061788,AERODYNAMICS,Analysis of induced velocities in the wake of a hovering helicopter rotor,"A simple analytical method has been developed to predict the induced velocities at the tip vortex in the wake of a hovering helicopter rotor. The wake model in the analysis includes the blade bound vortex as well as a tip vortex and vortex sheet trailed from each blade. Standard, prescribed wake models were used to describe the geometry of the tip vortex and the vortex sheet. Curved vortex elements were used to model the tip vortices and the vortex sheets. The analysis was used to study the contribution from each wake component to the axial-induced velocity of the tip vortex. Results show a highly variable induced velocity at the tip vortex both before and after the first blade passage. However, the prescribed tip vortex models require a constant axial velocity of the tip vortex. This inconsistency between the prescribed axial velocity of the tip vortex and the velocity that the wake geometry induces on the tip vortex points to a limitation of the current prescribed tip vortex geometry models.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The freestream Mach numbers are 1.5 and 1.6, the unit Reynolds number and the total temperature are 2 million/ft, and 585 R, respectively. Among the possible areas of application for this study are the aerodynamics of separating stores and missiles. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved by an approximately-factored, implicit, upwind-biased, finite-volume algorithm. The convergence to steady state was accelerated using a multigrid strategy. The results helped understanding the structure of the flowfield with varying incidence and configuration, and the suitability of the computational algorithm used for this class of flows. A two-layer algebraic eddy viscosity model is used for the two-dimensional turbulent flows.

The sharp leading edge vortex flaps consisted of the outboard 30 percent of the local wing semispan. Flap deflections of 0, 5, 10, and 15 deg were investigated, for both a wing-alone and a wing-body configuration. The flaps were effective in reducing the drag across the lift-coefficient range. Integration of the upper surface pressure distributions showed that the suction pressures induced by the vortex on the flap were responsible for the drag reductions. At some lift conditions, the minimum drag condition permitted hinge line separation or vortex migration inboard of the hinge line. This result is in contrast to subsonic results, where optimum conditions call for no hinge line separation. The magnitude of the drag reduction due to flap deflection generally decreased as Mach number increased. The effect of a cylindrical forebody on the drag reduction due to flap deflection was minimal.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Results indicate a longitudinal center-of-pressure travel of about 23 percent of the fuselage length for the test Mach number range, with longitudinal instabilities noted at high-supersonic to hypersonic Mach numbers. These instabilities are coupled with directional instability at similar Mach numbers.

This allows the design method to be straightforwardly coupled with any existing analysis code, as presently undertaken with several two- and three-dimensional potential flow codes.

It was shown that increasing the degree of twist for the silica thread produced an optimum twist level until all the yarn finish was removed. The break strength of both ABS threads was inversely proportional to the degree of twist caused by increased filament breakage with increasing twist that was controlled by the gradual removal of the polymeric processing aids. At elevated temperatures, above 950 C, strength loss was observed for both ABS threads because of the presence of a glass phase that softens and causes fiber deformation. This was not observed for the silica thread at similar test temperatures because of the higher viscosity of the pure silica glass phase.",2013-08-13,1987-07-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870062111,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,Effects of substrate misorientation and background impurities on electron transport in molecular-beam-epitaxial grown GaAs/AlGaAs modulation-doped quantum-well structures,"The effects of substrate misorientation off the (001) plane and of background impurities on electron transport in MBE-grown GaAs/AlGaAs modulation-doped superlattice-buffered quantum-well structures were investigated. Low-field transport data were obtained on GaAs/AlGaAs structures grown on substrates oriented 0, 2, 4, and 6.5 deg off the (001) plane towards either (111)A or (111)B. It is shown that the low-field two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) mobility is a function of the angle and direction of the substrate orientation, and that the 2DEG mobility is a function of the direction of the applied electric field in the GaAs quantum well. The anisotropy in the 2DEG mobility is also a function of the tilt angle and tilt azimuth direction of the substrate from the (001) plane. In addition, it is shown that the amount of interface scattering from the inverted interface is a sensitive function of the amount of background impurities in the MBE machine.",2013-08-13,1987-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870062118,ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,Intrusions in the active layer of channeled-substrate-planar laser diodes,"Channeled-substrate-planar laser diodes from various wafers were observed to develop a node or dark spot in their near-field patterns after failure during lifetesting. 'Node' devices from each wafer were angle-lapped and stained in an attempt to uncover a physical mechanism for this common failure symptom. Optical microscopic examination of the beveled cross sections revealed that an intrusion, in the form of a spike at the tip of the zinc diffusion front, had penetrated into the active layer of these diodes. The node observed in the near-field pattern appears to be in a position correspondig to the location of the spike in the active region. In addition, cathodoluminescence measurements on other 'node' diodes revealed a dark line region approximately 2-micron-wide running parallel to and in the middle of the 5-micron contact stripe. It is believed that this dark line region is representative of an area of nonradiative recombination which occurs in the portion of the active layer containing the intrusion.",2013-08-13,1987-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870062185,ASTROPHYSICS,A near-infrared study of the luminous merging galaxies NGC 2623 and Arp 148,"A broad-band spectral decomposition method has been developed to determine the contributions of evolved stars, H II regions, warm dust, and obscuration to the near-infrared continuum in interacting systems. The multicolor decomposition is applied to near-infrared measurements of the long-tailed galaxy NGC 2623 and the ring system Arp 148 to determine the galactic structure and to delineate regions of galactic activity. The infrared analysis confirms that these galaxies are coalescing; since a single nucleus is observed in the infrared, the merger must be complete. Arp 148 is found to be the product of a close collision of two galaxies, and the multicolor analysis implies that this system is in an early stage of coalescence. A substantial fraction of the nuclear regions of Arp 148 and NGC 2623 may be attributed to the presence of young stars.",2013-08-13,1987-04-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870062202,ASTROPHYSICS,Einstein Observatory survey of X-ray emission from solar-type stars - The late F and G dwarf stars,"Results of a volume-limited X-ray survey of stars of luminosity classes IV and V in the spectral range F7-G9 observed with the Einstein Observatory are presented. Using survival analysis techniques, the stellar X-ray luminosity function in the 0.15-4.0 keV energy band for both single and multiple sources. It is shown that the difference in X-ray luminosity between these two classes of sources is consistent with the superposition of individual components in multiple-component systems, whose X-ray properties are similar to those of the single-component sources. The X-ray emission of the stars in our sample is well correlated with their chromospheric CA II H-K line emission and with their projected equatorial rotational velocity. Comparison of the X-ray luminosity function constructed for the sample of the dG stars of the local population with the corresponding functions derived elsewhere for the Hyades, the Pleiades, and the Orion Ic open cluster confirms that the level of X-ray emission decreases with stellar age.",2013-08-13,1987-04-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870062204,SOLAR PHYSICS,Solar wind diagnostics from Doppler-enhanced scattering,"Solar wind ions can attain sufficient outflow speed, w, to cause line excitation by chromospheric or transition region radiation in a nearby line. It is shown that this extends the diagnostic possibilities of a coronal EUV line to much larger values of w than would be possible if pumping were limited to radiation from the same spectral line. For the 1037.6 A coronal line of O VI, the pumping effect of the chromospheric C II 1037.0 A line is efficient for w between 100 and 250 km/s. An approximate expression for the line ratio for a doublet of the Li or Na isoelectronic sequences is derived, and the diagnostic capabilities of doublet line ratios, either by themselves or combined with the observation of other quantities, are discussed. In particular, that the determination of doublet line ratios at several heights can be sufficient to yield the solar wind velocity at those heights together with a constraint on other coronal parameters.",2013-08-13,1987-04-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Each set consists of coaligned, high spatial resolution soft X-ray, microwave, and magnetogram images that are used to compare observations of coronal loops and their feet in the photosphere and to constrain possible microwave emission mechanisms. The loops are found to have plasma parameters typical of quiescent active region loops. Each loop has a compact microwave source with peak brightness temperature T(b) = 1-2.5 x 10 to the 6th K cospatial with or near the loop apex. No complete loops are imaged in microwaves. The loop emission observed at 4.9 GHz is best described by fourth harmonic gyroresonance emission from a dipole loop model, but with less field variation along the loop than in the models of Holman and Kundu (1985).",2013-08-13,1987-04-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870062219,ASTROPHYSICS,SiO cooling instability in the envelopes of cool giant stars,"In the outer atmospheres of oxygen-rich giant and supergiant stars, the formation of the silicon monoxide molecule not only represents a first step toward the production of dust but may also produce an efficient radiative cooling agent. Molecular cooling occurs as a thermal instability in many cases with an onset at 2000 to 3500 K, rapidly reducing the temperature by as much as 1000 K. This process may occur in the upper photosphere-lower chromosphere of such stars and can have profound dynamical consequences. The process occurs far from LTE, on a time scale controlled by the reaction rates for SiO formation. SiO masers may be indicative of this process.

19870062221,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Beaming of Uranian kilometric radiation and implications for the planetary magnetic field,"Radio waves from Uranus at 481.2 kHz detected by Voyager 2 show a strong beaming effect. When the data are analyzed according to the magnetic latitude of the observer in an offset tilted dipole field model, a sharply defined emission beam extending from 25 to 55 deg latitude is evident consistent with a source over the south magnetic pole. The lack of prominent emission from the north magnetic pole can be attributed to the large spatial offset of the magnetic dipole resulting in much lower source frequencies. For proper alignment of the beam, an advance of the dipole axis longitude by 23 deg from the standard model is required. This phase shift is interpreted as the result of higher order magnetic moments producing a skew of the field lines at low altitudes in the polar source region. This conclusion further substantiates models of the interior of Uranus which predict a complex intrinsic field with significant nondipolar contributions to the surface magnetic field.",2013-08-13,1987-04-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870062285,METALLIC MATERIALS,Characterization of hydrogen embrittlement in nickel base superalloy single crystals,"In order to study the role of CMSX2 single crystal microstructure on the combined stress-hydrogen environment effects, hydrogen was introduced by cathodic charging. Concentration measurements were carried out to investigate the dependence of hydrogen solubility and trapping on microstructure. Mechanical properties were measured at room temperature on smooth tensile specimens as a function of heat treatment, crystal orientation and H charging conditions. SEM and TEM allow to study H induced cracks initiation and propagation. A large amount of hydrogen can be dissolved and trapped in CMSX2 single crystals when exposed to a high hydrogen fugacity environment. The strong H trapping evidenced in voids explains the predominant role of these defects as crack initiation sites.

Fourteen Attitude Command/Attitude Hold, Rate, and Rate Command/Attitude Hold configurations were evaluated by six pilots using both conventional controls and a four-axis integrated sidestick over a low-speed course consisting of precision hover, landing, sidestep, and dash/quickstop tasks. The results indicate that with conventional controls all three response-types were acceptable as long as their response bandwidth was sufficiently high, and higher bandwidths were required in roll than in pitch. With the four-axis sidestick, there was a preference for the Rate systems. The range of acceptable bandwidths was lower, and the spread in pilot ratings smaller, than were found in a similar ground-based simulation.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The studies involved low-speed wind-tunnel tests of actuated forebody strake concepts applied to a generic fighter model and included circumferential pressure and flow visualization surveys on an isolated forebody. Results showed that the actuated forebody strake concept can provide high levels of yaw control over wide ranges of angle-of-attack and sideslip. However, when lifting surfaces were placed in close proximity to the forebody/strake combination, significant interaction effects occurred which reduced the yaw control effectiveness of the strakes and induced coupled rolling and pitching moments.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

However, the interlaminar shear strength of the brominated composite was 18 percent greater than its pristine counterpart. Only slight differences were observed in flexural properties. A five-fold decrease was observed in the electrical resistivity of the brominated composite parallel to the axis of the fibers, resulting in a unidirectional resistivity of about 90 microOmega/cm. Transverse resistivity was unaffected.

Although a clear periodicity in the E greater 35 MeV gamma radiation is observed at the 4.79 hr period seen in X-rays, there is no evidence for major variations of the radiation from one day to the next, and no statistically significant evidence for bursts on the 10-minute time scale seen in the infrared or very high energy ranges.

The mean value of log R for 73 galactic planetaries is 1.4, while that of extragalactic planetaries appears to be slightly lower, and that for symbiotics is 0.3. The lower value of log R for symbiotics is easily understood as a consequence of their higher densities. A plot of log R versus N-epsilon indicates that 80 percent of the planetaries fall into the range of log R between 1.2 and 1.8, but some of the 'peculiar' and bipolar nebulae fall below log R = 1.2.

In the case of purely radiation-driven accretion onto a central object such as the cD galaxy M87, it is found that the gas is largely subject to overstability, rather than to monotonic instability. If thermal conductivity is taken into account, the flow is stabilized on scales of several kiloparsecs, even if the conductivity is appreciably reduced (e.g., about 1 percent) with respect to the Spitzer value. In no case are the globular perturbations (i.e., perturbations with comparable radial and azimuthal dimensions) found to be monotonically unstable. The paper presents numerical solutions of the local dispersion relation for the cooling flow in M87 and discusses the possible consequences of the results for a correct understanding of cooling flows.",2013-08-13,1987-08-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The 1B flare, as observed in H alpha at Mees Solar Observatory, Maui, Hawaii, appeared as two sequential flares occurring at different neutral lines. The peaks of the time profile at 20 cm were delayed with respect to the 6 cm counterparts, but they were related to each other and to the H alpha activity. At 20 cm, precursor activity occurred, and an oppositely polarized source an arcminute away from the main burst may have triggered the flare. The main 20 cm emission appeared to be displaced limbward from the 6 cm burst. If both the 6 and 20 cm emission originated in the same system of loops, it is inferred that the apparent lateral displacement was caused by a height difference of 33,000 km in the sources of emission.",2013-08-13,1987-08-15,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870064902,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Low-loss offset feeds for electrically large symmetric dual-reflector antennas,"Circularly symmetric, dual reflector, high gain antenna systems often require feeds placed off the system's axis because of the need for multiple feeds to use the reflector antenna. Also, the constraint requiring the hyperboloid or shaped subreflector to remain circularly symmetric is sometimes added. In a Cassegrainian system, the subreflector and feed may be rotated off axis around the paraboloid focus and retain main reflector focusing. However, substantial spillover results in considerable noise with a high gain/low noise temperature system. In a shaped system, the tilt of the shaped subreflector and feed together results in substantial defocusing as well as spillover noise. If the subreflector is tilted approximately one-half the angle of the feed tilt in either the Casegrainian or the dual shaped reflector antenna, it is found that spillover and noise are substantially reduced with tolerable defocusing. An extensive numerical analysis of these effects was conducted to determine the characteristics of a planned 70-meter, dual shaped reflector versus Cassegrainian antenna and to gain some understanding of the cause of the observed effects.",2013-08-13,1987-07-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Potential advantages of this design include improved capability to burn non-standard fuels, short system length, and increased operating temperature range for advanced high performance engine cycles. After considerable development, key program emissons and performance goals were met with the variable geometry combustor. Primary development efforts were to evolve improved variable swirl cup configurations. In particular, air leakage through the variable area swirl cup had a strong effect on low power emissions and performance, while smoke level at high power was affected by features for improved mixing of the fuel and swirler air flow. Additional design and development is still needed to evolve a practical variable geometry combustor.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870065177,ACOUSTICS,A new approach to the effect of sound on vortex dynamics,"Analytical results are presented on the effect of acoustic radiation on three-dimensional vortex motions in a homogeneous, slightly compressible, inviscid fluid. The flow is considered as linear and irrotational everywhere except inside a very thin cylindrical core region around the vortex filament. In the outside region, a velocity potential is introduced that must be multivalued, and it is shown how to compute this scalar potential if the motion of the vortex filament is prescribed. To find the motion of this singularity in an external potential flow, a variational principle involving a volume integral that must exclude the singular region is considered. A functional of the external potential and vortex filament position is obtained whose extrema give equations to determine the sought-after evolution. Thus, a generalization of the Biot-Savart law to flows with constant sound speed at low Mach number is obtained.",2013-08-13,1987-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870065187,PLASMA PHYSICS,Anode-type double layers in a nonuniform magnetic field,"The properties of strong, magnetized, three-dimensional double layers are studied. The double layers are produced by drawing a discharge to a large anode plate located in the diverging magnetic field region of a cylindrical argon discharge. If the anode voltage is sufficiently high, the electrons that are accelerated through the anode sheath may become sufficiently energetic to ionize the background neutral gas and transform the anode sheath into a strong double layer. The resulting conical-shaped structures, which extend outward from the plate, have parallel, oblique, and perpendicular electric field components with respect to the magnetic field. The axial extent of these structures depends on the plate bias voltage, neutral gas pressure, and the magnetic field. At neutral gas pressures of a few millitorr, the double-layer structures are visually apparent because of the enhanced light emission from neutrals excited by the energetic electrons. Color photographs of some of these structures are shown. The scaling of the width of these double layers with electric field components perpendicular to B is also investigated.",2013-08-13,1987-08-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Predicted performance parameters include detective and net quantum efficiencies, split-event probability, and a parameter characterizing the effective thickness presented by the detector to cosmic-ray protons. The predicted performance of two CCDs of different epitaxial layer thicknesses is compared.

19870065267,COMPUTER PROGRAMMING AND SOFTWARE,Increasing processor utilization during parallel computation rundown,"Some parallel processing environments provide for asynchronous execution and completion of general purpose parallel computations from a single computational phase. When all the computations from such a phase are complete, a new parallel computational phase is begun. Depending upon the granularity of the parallel computations to be performed, there may be a shortage of available work as a particular computational phase draws to a close (computational rundown). This can result in the waste of computing resources and the delay of the overall problem. In many practical instances, strict sequential ordering of phases of parallel computation is not totally required. In such cases, the beginning of one phase can be correctly computed before the end of a previous phase is completed. This allows additional work to be generated somewhat earlier to keep computing resources busy during each computational rundown. The conditions under which this can occur are identified and the frequency of occurrence of such overlapping in an actual parallel Navier-Stokes code is reported. A language construct is suggested and possible control strategies for the management of such computational phase overlapping are discsused.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870065448,CYBERNETICS,Shifting the closed-loop spectrum in the optimal linear quadratic regulator problem for hereditary systems,"In the optimal linear quadratic regulator problem for finite dimensional systems, the method known as an alpha-shift can be used to produce a closed-loop system whose spectrum lies to the left of some specified vertical line; that is, a closed-loop system with a prescribed degree of stability. This paper treats the extension of the alpha-shift to hereditary systems. As infinite dimensions, the shift can be accomplished by adding alpha times the identity to the open-loop semigroup generator and then solving an optimal regulator problem. However, this approach does not work with a new approximation scheme for hereditary control problems recently developed by Kappel and Salamon. Since this scheme is among the best to date for the numerical solution of the linear regulator problem for hereditary systems, an alternative method for shifting the closed-loop spectrum is needed. An alpha-shift technique that can be used with the Kappel-Salamon approximation scheme is developed. Both the continuous-time and discrete-time problems are considered. A numerical example which demonstrates the feasibility of the method is included.",2013-08-13,1987-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870065520,CYBERNETICS,The capacity of the Hopfield associative memory,"Techniques from coding theory are applied to study rigorously the capacity of the Hopfield associative memory. Such a memory stores n-tuple of + or - 1s. The components change depending on a hard-limited version of linear functions of all other components. With symmetric connections between components, a stable state is ultimately reached. By building up the connection matrix as a sum-of-outer products of m fundamental memories, it may be possible to recover a certain one of the m memories by using an initial n-tuple probe vector less than a Hamming distance n/2 away from the fundamental memory. If m fundamental memories are chosen at random, the maximum asymptotic value of m in order that most of the m original memories are exactly recoverable is n/(2 log n).

One-time inputs of ambient conditions and airplane configuration information are used in the pretakeoff segment to generate schedule performance data for that takeoff. The real-time segment uses the scheduled performance data generated in the pretakeoff segment, runway length data, and measured parameters to monitor the performance of the airplane throughout the takeoff roll. Airplane and engine performance deficiencies are detected and annunciated. An important feature of this algorithm is the one-time estimation of the runway rolling friction coefficient.

19870065999,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Speckle noise reduction of 1-look SAR imagery,"Speckle noise is inherent to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Since the degradation of the image due to this noise results in uncertainties in the interpretation of the scene and in a loss of apparent resolution, it is desirable to filter the image to reduce this noise. In this paper, an adaptive algorithm based on the calculation of the local statistics around a pixel is applied to 1-look SAR imagery. The filter adapts to the nonstationarity of the image statistics since the size of the blocks is very small compared to that of the image. The performance of the filter is measured in terms of the equivalent number of looks (ENL) of the filtered image and the resulting resolution degradation. The results are compared to those obtained from different techniques applied to similar data. The local adaptive filter (LAF) significantly increases the ENL of the final image. The associated loss of resolution is also lower than that for other commonly used speckle reduction techniques.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

This interest started in the early 1950s with attempts to apply oxides, borides, and cermets as gas turbine components. These attempts, as other similar efforts around the world at that time, generally met with failure due to the brittle nature of the materials and a lack of understanding of how to accommodate brittleness by appropriate design approaches. More recent efforts of the 1970s have concentrated on the silicon nitride and silicon carbide family of ceramics. This class of materials demonstrated thermal stability and thermal shock resistance in gas turbine environments. Subsequent programs funded by the DOE and managed by NASA have demonstrated great strides in material fabricability and the application of FEM design concepts. However, the materials remain brittle and lacking in reliability and reproducibility.

Such a flow does not affect perturbations with wave vectors perpendicular to the flow. For perturbations with wave vectors parallel to the flow, the onset of morphological instability is somewhat suppressed and thermosolutal convection is greatly suppressed. When instabilities occur, they are oscillatory and correspond to travelling waves. For values of the crystal growth velocity for which mixed morphological and convective modes occur, the presence of a forced flow produces sufficient decoupling to allow otherwise degenerate branches to be identified.",2013-08-13,1984-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Previous 'alpha effect' and 'beta effect' coefficients emerge as limiting cases. A treatment of the inertial range can also be given, consistent with a -5/3 energy spectrum power law.

Those samples of CaS suspected to be more primitive on the basis of their minor element and petrologic siting contain the entire inventory of the host meteorite's light REE (LREE) and Eu, plus 30-50 percent of the heavy-REE inventory. In less primitive samples, the LREE are less enriched although Eu remains highly concentrated.

The isotropic multiply scattered flux at the surface is shown to be an increasing function of the opacity (tau) for tau of less than about 2.5. At large tau values, the maximum in the downward directed scattered flux still increases, but occurs at a height of several radii above the nucleus, resulting in a reduction at the surface.

A definite enhancement of LECP fluxes within the core regions (where the PLS densities and magnetic-field pressure are lower than in the surrounding regions) is shown, indicating that this hot tenuous plasma is present within the core regions. In general there is a strong anticorrelation between PLS density and LECP fluxes, while a less pronounced anticorrelation between magnetic-field pressure and LECP fluxes is observed. Estimates of LECP pressures suggest that this hot plasma can provide the previously described missing pressure in the core if heavy ions dominate the ion composition. The angular dependence of the LECP data indicates a flow of this hot plasma in the anti-Jupiter direction. This outflowing plasma could be the remnant of the magnetospheric wind observed near Jupiter by LECP.

The source frequency is chosen so that the eigensolutions with that frequency have an 'interactive' structure in the region of marginal separation. The eigensolution wavelength scale must then differ from the lengthscale of the marginal separation, and a composite expansion technique has to be used to obtain the solution.

The simulation results provide insight to high frequency pilot induced oscillations (PIO) (roll ratchet), low frequency PIO, and roll-to-right control and handling problems previously observed in experimental and production fly-by-wire control systems. The simulation configurations encompass and/or duplicate actual flight situations, reproduce control problems observed in flight, and validate the concept that the high frequency nuisance mode known as roll ratchet derives primarily from the pilot's neuromuscular subsystem. The simulations show that force-sensing side-stick manipulator force/displacement/command gradients, command prefilters, and flight control system time delays need to be carefully adjusted to minimize neuromuscular mode amplitude peaking (roll ratchet tendency) without restricting roll control bandwidth (with resulting sluggish or PIO prone control).",2013-09-05,1986-05-01,/api/citations/19880000657/downloads/19880000657.pdf,/api/citations/19880000657/downloads/19880000657.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

These stations were located about 42 degrees from the sub-solar point, and consequently, these is approximately 1400 grams of atmosphere between the incident neutrons at the top of the atmosphere and their detection on the Earth's surface. Nevertheless, the time coincidence of a small increase in the total counting rate of two independent neutron monitors indicates the presence of solar neutrons with energies greater than 400 MeV at the top of the Earth's atmosphere.

In this frequency range, type II events are generally associated with other radio emissions (such as storms of type III-U-I bursts); they are preceeded or followed by groups of U-bursts. One third of type II events show a nonuniform frequency drift, usually a steep decrease followed by an abrupt increase. This phenomenon can be explained by the propagation of an extended disturbance through the ambient corona when the density gradient is enhanced. An empirical coronal model is proposed to interpret these observations. The observations at fixed frequency of Type II bursts including fundamental and harmonic components are analyzed.

The converse (i.e., decrease of the Alfven discontinuity's intensity following interaction with a less dense plasma) is also indicated. Also discussed is the generation of a magnetic cloud as the result of the interaction of a quasi-parallel Alfven discontinuity with a dense plasma contact surface. It is shown that the (solar-generated) Alfven discontinuity may then be transformed into non-flare fast and slow shock waves as the result of this interaction.

At Mach 0.6 and 0.8, nozzle pressure coefficient distributions and nozzle axial force coefficients agreed and showed good recompression. At Mach 0.9 and 1.2, flow complexity caused a loss in recompression for both flight and wind tunnel nozzle data. The flight data exhibited less negative values of pressure coefficient and lower axial force coefficients than did the wind tunnel data. Reynolds number effects were noted only at these Mach numbers. Jet temperature and mass flux ratio did not affect the comparisons of nozzle axial flow coefficient.

Since the induced flow plays a significant role in determining the aeroelastic properties of rotorcraft, the computation of the induced flow is an important aspect of the program. Because of the combined finite-element/multibody methodology used as the basis for GRASP, the implementation of induced velocity calculations presented an unusual challenge to the developers. To preserve the modelling flexibility and generality of the code, it was necessary to depart from the traditional methods of computing the induced velocity.

Convection is visualized by a Schlieren optical system or a Mach Zender interferometer. For ice crystals growing from the vapor in air, a slight reduction in linear growth rate occur under low g. For ice crystals growing from NaCl solution, dendrite tip velocities are unchanged, but subsequent mush solidification is enhanced through drainage channels under higher g. By contrast, sodium sulfate decahydrate dendrites growing from solution produce convective plumes which lead to higher tip growth rate only as the crystal growth direction approaches that of gravity. Convective plumes are laminar for small crystals under conditions of these experiments; the rise velocity of such plumes is greater than individual vortex rings under identical conditions. Convection effects are only present in solution under a critical supercooling less than about 5 C for sodium sulfate and 2 C for ice in NaCl since at higher supercooling the crystallization velocity, proportional to the square of the supercooling, exceeds the convective  velocity, proportional to the square root of the supercooling. The role of convective velocity in bulk solidification is to give a large scale flow which under extreme cases may lead to extensive secondary crystal production, which alters the resulting crystal texture of the completely solidified melt.",2013-09-05,1987-08-01,/api/citations/19880001597/downloads/19880001597.pdf,/api/citations/19880001597/downloads/19880001597.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The magnitude of counting errors were analyzed because these errors contribute to inaccurate liquid water content measurements. The Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer counting errors due to data transfer losses and coincidence losses were analyzed for data input rates from 10 samples/sec to 70,000 samples/sec. Coincidence losses were calculated by determining the Poisson probability of having more than one event occurring during the droplet signal time. The magnitude of the coincidence loss can be determined, and for less than a 15 percent loss, corrections can be made. The data transfer losses were estimated for representative data transfer rates. With direct memory access enabled, data transfer losses are less than 5 percent for input rates below 2000 samples/sec. With direct memory access disabled losses exceeded 20 percent at a rate of 50 samples/sec preventing accurate number density or mass flux measurements. The data transfer losses of a new signal processor were analyzed and found to be less than 1 percent for rates under 65,000 samples/sec.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880002661/downloads/19880002661.pdf,/api/citations/19880002661/downloads/19880002661.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880002821,GEOPHYSICS,An algorithmic approach to crustal deformation analysis,"In recent years the analysis of crustal deformation measurements has become important as a result of current improvements in geodetic methods and an increasing amount of theoretical and observational data provided by several earth sciences. A first-generation data analysis algorithm which combines a priori information with current geodetic measurements was proposed. Relevant methods which can be used in the algorithm were discussed. Prior information is the unifying feature of this algorithm. Some of the problems which may arise through the use of a priori information in the analysis were indicated and preventive measures were demonstrated. The first step in the algorithm is the optimal design of deformation networks. The second step in the algorithm identifies the descriptive model of the deformation field. The final step in the algorithm is the improved estimation of deformation parameters. Although deformation parameters are estimated in the process of model discrimination, they can further be improved by the use of a priori information about them. According to the proposed algorithm this information must first be tested against the estimates calculated using the sample data only. Null-hypothesis testing procedures were developed for this purpose. Six different estimators which employ a priori information were examined. Emphasis was put on the case when the prior information is wrong and analytical expressions for possible improvements under incompatible prior information were derived.",2013-09-05,1987-10-01,/api/citations/19880002821/downloads/19880002821.pdf,/api/citations/19880002821/downloads/19880002821.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Experimental data indicates that these rates are different from those recorded for plants grown in open field agriculture, or in open growth chambers. Since higher plants are a crucial component of a controlled ecological life support system (CELSS), it is important that the consequences of these rate differences be understood with regard to the growth and yield of the plants.

Mapping a simulation onto a message-passing architecture is especially difficult when the computational workload dynamically changes as a function of time and space; this is exactly the situation faced by battlefield simulations. This paper studies an approach where the simulated battlefield domain is first partitioned into many regions of equal size; typically there are more regions than processors. The regions are then assigned to processors; a processor is responsible for performing all simulation activity associated with the regions. The assignment algorithm is quite simple and attempts to balance load by exploiting locality of workload intensity. The performance of this technique is studied on a simple battlefield simulation implemented on the Flex/32 multiprocessor. Measurements show that the proposed method achieves reasonable processor efficiencies. Furthermore, the method shows promise for use in dynamic remapping of the simulation.",2013-09-05,1987-10-01,/api/citations/19880002905/downloads/19880002905.pdf,/api/citations/19880002905/downloads/19880002905.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Emphasis is on downwind data, but some upwind measurements taken during the 1985 experiment are also considered. General ray theory for a moving medium is reviewed and ray equations obtained. Restrictions are introduced simplifying the equations and permitting the use of a ray theory program MEDUSA, the computed propagation loss curve of which is compared to the measurements. Good qualitative agreement is obtained with 1984 downwind data. The results indicate that the downwind sound field is that of a near-ground sound channel. Although more scatter is seen in the 1985 data, agreement between theory and data is also good. In particular, the position and magnitude of the jump in the sound levels associated with the beginning of the sound channel is correctly predicted. The theoretical explanation of the upwind data is less successful. Ray theory calculations indicate the formation of a shadow zone that, in fact, does not occur. While no sharp shadow zone is apparent in the data, the general expectation (based on ray theory) that sound levels should be much reduced upwind is confirmed by the data.",2013-09-05,1987-07-01,/api/citations/19880002967/downloads/19880002967.pdf,/api/citations/19880002967/downloads/19880002967.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The data indicated that planform has a small effect on the zero lift drag of a multibody configuration. The longitudinal data obtained at lifting conditions showed a sensitivity to planform shape. Lateral-directional data obtained for all configurations did not uncover any unusual stability traits for this class of configuration. A comparison study was also made between the planform effects observed on single-body and multibody configurations. Results from this study indicate that the multibody concept appears to offer a mechanism for employing a low-sweep wing with no significant increase in zero-lift drag but still retaining high-performance characteristics at high-lift conditions.

19880003091,AIR TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY,Experimental evidence for modifying the current physical model for ice accretion on aircraft surfaces,"Closeup movies, still photographs, and other experimental data suggest that the current physical model for ice accretion needs significant modification. At aircraft airspeeds there was no flow of liquid over the surface of the ice after a short initial flow, even at barely subfreezing temperatures. Instead, there were very large stationary drops on the ice surface that lose water from their bottoms by freezing and replenish their liquid by catching the microscopic cloud droplets. This observation disagrees with the existing physical model, which assumes there is a thin liquid film continuously flowing over the ice surface. With no such flow, the freezing-fraction concept of the model fails when a mass balance is performed on the surface water. Rime ice does, as the model predicts, form when the air temperature is low enough to cause the cloud droplets to freeze almost immediately on impact. However, the characteristic shapes of horn-glaze ice or rime ice are primarily caused by the ice shape affecting the airflow locally and consequently the droplet catch and the resulting ice shape. Ice roughness greatly increases the heat transfer coefficient, stops the movement of drops along the surface, and may also affect the airflow initially and thereby the droplet catch. At high subreezing temperatures the initial flow and shedding of surface drops have a large effect on the ice shape. At the incipient freezing limit, no ice forms.",2013-09-05,1986-01-01,/api/citations/19880003091/downloads/19880003091.pdf,/api/citations/19880003091/downloads/19880003091.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A consistent set of physical properties data is assembled for the various candidate metals and inert ambient gases expected to be used in the nucleation experiments. Transient partial pressure profiles are computed for the diffusing refractory species for two possible temperature distributions. The supersaturation ratio values from both candidate temperature profiles are compared with previously obtained experimetnal data on a silver-hydrogen system. The model is used to simulate the diffusion of magnesium vapor through argon and other inert gas atmospheres over ranges of initial and boundary conditions. These results identify different combinations of design and operating parameters which are liekly to produce supersaturation ratio values high enough to induce homogeneous nucleation in the apparatus being designed for the microgravity nucleation experiments.",2013-09-05,1987-12-01,/api/citations/19880003237/downloads/19880003237.pdf,/api/citations/19880003237/downloads/19880003237.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880003298,ASTRODYNAMICS,A demonstration of high precision GPS orbit determination for geodetic applications,"High precision orbit determination of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites is a key requirement for GPS-based precise geodetic measurements and precise low-earth orbiter tracking, currently under study at JPL. Different strategies for orbit determination have been explored at JPL with data from a 1985 GPS field experiment. The most successful strategy uses multi-day arcs for orbit determination and includes fine tuning of spacecraft solar pressure coefficients and station zenith tropospheric delays using the GPS data. Average rms orbit repeatability values for 5 of the GPS satellites are 1.0, 1.2, and 1.7 m in altitude, cross-track, and down-track componenets when two independent 5-day fits are compared. Orbit predictions up to 24 hours outside the multi-day arcs agree within 4 m of independent solutions obtained with well tracked satellites in the prediction interval. Baseline repeatability improves with multi-day as compared to single-day arc orbit solutions. When tropospheric delay fluctuations are modeled with process noise, significant additional improvement in baseline repeatability is achieved. For a 246-km baseline, with 6-day arc solutions for GPS orbits, baseline repeatability is 2 parts in 100 million (0.4-0.6 cm) for east, north, and length components and 8 parts in 100 million for the vertical component. For 1314 and 1509 km baselines with the same orbits, baseline repeatability is 2 parts in 100 million for the north components (2-3 cm) and 4 parts in 100 million or better for east, length, and vertical components.",2013-09-05,1987-11-15,/api/citations/19880003298/downloads/19880003298.pdf,/api/citations/19880003298/downloads/19880003298.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

After considering some basic synchronization mechanisms, a collection of barrier algorithms with either linear or logarithmic depth are presented. A graphical model is described that profiles the execution of the barriers and other parallel programming constructs. This model shows how the interaction between the barrier algorithms and the work that they synchronize can impact their performance. One result is that logarithmic tree structured barriers show good performance when synchronizing fixed length work, while linear self-scheduled barriers show better performance when synchronizing fixed length work with an imbedded critical section. The linear barriers are better able to exploit the process skew associated with critical sections.

Prior to the final testing software goes through a debugging period and many models have been developed to try to estimate reliability from the debugging data.

Thus, the user is relieved of the tedious and error-prone process of model construction, permitting an efficient exploration of the design space, and an independent validation of the system's operation is obtained.

We describe VISTA's engine operation, discuss associated plasma issues, and describe the advantages of DT fuel for near-term applications. Although ICF is potentially superior to non-fusion technologies for near-term interplanetary transport, the performance capabilities of VISTA cannot be meaningfully compared with those of magnetic-fusion systems because of the lack of a comparable study of the magnetic-fusion systems.

In contrast, the experience with the three-dimensional testing of swept panels in adaptive wall test sections is very limited, except for some activity in the 1940's at NPL, London. The current interest in testing swept wing panels led to the work covered by this report, which describes the design of an adaptive-wall swept-wing test section for a low speed wind tunnel and gives test results for a wing panel swept at 40 deg. The test section has rigid flat sidewalls supporting the panel, and features flexible top and bottom wall with ribs swept at the same angle as the wing. When streamlined, the walls form waves swept at the same angle as the wing.

Part 1: Theory and simulation,"Identification of the system parameters of a randomly excited structure may be treated using a variety of statistical techniques. Of all these techniques, the Random Decrement is unique in that it provides the homogeneous component of the system response. Using this quality, a system identification technique was developed based on a least-squares fit of the signatures to estimate the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices of a linear randomly excited system. The mathematics of the technique is presented in addition to the results of computer simulations conducted to demonstrate the prediction of the response of the system and the random forcing function initially introduced to excite the system.",2013-09-05,1987-10-01,/api/citations/19880004243/downloads/19880004243.pdf,/api/citations/19880004243/downloads/19880004243.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Treatments were applied to an even-aged forest of Douglas fir trees. Work to date has stressed wet chemical analysis of foilage samples and correction of AIS data. Plot treatments were successful in providing a range of foliar N2 concentrations. Much time was spent investigating and correcting problems with the raw AIS data. Initial problems with groups of drop out lines in the AIS data were traced to the tape recorder and the tape drive. Custom adjustment of the tape drive led to recovery of most missing lines. Remaining individual drop out lines were replaced using average of adjacent lines. Application of a notch filter to the Fourier transform of the image in each band satisfactorily removed vertical striping.

The first 2 sites are hydrothermally altered to a quartz-sericite-tourmaline mineralogy. The first AIS-2 data set showed numerous line dropouts and a considerable number of randomly distributed dark pixels. A second decommutation reduced the dropout essentially to near zero and the dark pixels by about 75 percent. Vertical striping was removed by histogram matching, column by column. A log residual spectrum was calculated which showed the departure of a 2 x 2 pixel area from the spatially and spectrally averaged scene. A 1:1 correlation was found with the log residual AIS-2 data and a large open pit area of gypsum.

The other half is dynamically controlled. Since the photochemical forcing is phased with the solar declination and modulated by air temperature variation in the upper stratosphere and the dynamic forcing is tied to wave activity in the upper troposphere, the total ozone column is a mixture of the two drivers. If the total ozone is used to infer a property of the dynamic field, namely the tropopause height, it is necessary to correct for the photochemical variations. It should be possible to remove the photochemical component of the total ozone by using SBUV profile information along the orbital track as long as the spatial variations are low frequency. The column integral above the Umkehr levels in the lower stratosphere are examined to determine the level where the spatial variability decreases to the expected photochemical range to find an approximate dividing line between photochemical and dynamic control. Given this a spherical harmonic function will be fitted to the ozone field and subtracted from the TOMS total ozone field. This residual field will then be correlated  with tropopause height to determine whether an improvement is obtained over the total ozone correlation.",2013-09-05,1987-12-01,/api/citations/19880004396/downloads/19880004396.pdf,/api/citations/19880004396/downloads/19880004396.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Measurements of dynamic response were made with the rotors mounted on an isolated nacelle, with varying tilt for nonuniform inflow. Low speed stall flutter tests were conducted at Mach numbers from 0.0 to 0.35. Measurements are compared to Eigen-solution flutter boundaries. Calculated 1P stress response agrees favorably with experiment. Predicted stall flutter boundaries correlate well with measured high stress regions. Stall flutter is significantly reduced by increased blade sweep. Susceptibility to stall flutter decreases rapidly with forward speed.",2013-09-05,1985-12-01,/api/citations/19880004714/downloads/19880004714.pdf,/api/citations/19880004714/downloads/19880004714.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The simulation was performed using the NASA Langley VMS simulation facility. The vehicle models were obtained as part of this research. The simulation results include complete response data and subjective pilot ratings and comments and so allow a variety of analyses. The subjective ratings and analysis of the time histories indicate that increased flexibility can lead to increased tracking errors, degraded handling qualities, and changes in the frequency content of the pilot inputs. These results, furthermore, are significantly affected by the visual cues available to the pilot.",2013-09-05,1987-12-01,/api/citations/19880004717/downloads/19880004717.pdf,/api/citations/19880004717/downloads/19880004717.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880004734,"SPACECRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",An analysis of the effect of aeroassist maneuvers on orbital transfer vehicle performance,"This paper summarizes a Langley Research Summer Scholars (LARSS) research project (Summer 1986) dealing with the topic of the effectiveness of aeroassist maneuvers to accomplish a change in the orbital inclination of an Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV). This task was subject to OTV design constraints, chief of which were the axial acceleration and the aerodynamic heating rate limits of the OTV. The use of vehicle thrust to replace lost kinetic energy and, thereby, to increase the maximum possible change in orbital inclination was investigated. A relation between time in the hover orbit and payload to LEO was established. The amount of plane change possible during this type of maneuver was checked for several runs and a possible thrusting procedure to increase the plane change and still get to LEO was suggested. Finally, the sensitivity of various target parameters to controllable independent variables was established, trades between the amount of control allowed, and payload to LEO suggested.",2013-09-05,1987-09-01,/api/citations/19880004734/downloads/19880004734.pdf,/api/citations/19880004734/downloads/19880004734.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A well established and documented CFD code was obtained, modified, and applied to laminar and turbulent flows of the type occurring in the SSME Hot Gas Manifold. The INS3D code was installed on the NASA-MSFC CRAY-XMP computer system and is currently being used by NASA engineers. Studies to perform a transient analysis of the FPB were conducted. The COBRA/TRAC code is recommended for simulating the transient flow of oxygen into the LOX manifold. Property data for modifying the code to represent LOX/GOX flow was collected. The ALFA code was developed and recommended for representing the transient combustion in the preburner. These two codes will couple through the transient boundary conditions to simulate the startup and/or shutdown of the fuel preburner.

JPL, in coordination with other NASA Centers, has carried out a research program to study the degradation and oxidation processes caused by interaction of these materials with atomic oxygen at an energy of 5 eV. In addition, energetic atomic oxygen is believed to be responsible for the shuttle glow first observed during the flight of STS-3. The shuttle glow phenomenon has been extensively studied and modeled because of its long-range potential impact on optical communication schemes and its more immediate impact on the Space Telescope. This report summarizes the results of certian material degradation and erosion experiments carried out aboard STS-8 between August 30, 1983 and September 5, 1983. Based on these data, a generic degradation model has been developed for common structural polymers.",2013-09-05,1987-12-15,/api/citations/19880004820/downloads/19880004820.pdf,/api/citations/19880004820/downloads/19880004820.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880004844,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Propagation effects on satellite systems at frequencies below 10 GHz: A handbook for satellite systems design,"Frequencies below 10 GHz continue to be used for a large portion of satellite service, and new applications, including mobile satellite service and the global positioning system, use frequencies below 10 GHz. As frequency decreases below 10 GHz, attenuation due to precipitation and gases decreases and ionospheric effects increase. Thus the ionosphere, which can be largely neglected above 10 GHz, receives major attention. Although attenuation and depolarization due to rain are less severe below 10 GHz than above, they are nevertheless still important and constitute another major topic. The handbook emphasizes the propagation effects on satellite communications but material that is pertinent to radio navigation and positioning systems and deep-space telecommunications is included as well. Chapter 1 through 7 describe the various propagation impairments, and Chapter 9 is devoted to the estimation or calculation of the magnitudes of these effects for use in system design. Chapter 10 covers link power budget equations and the role of propagation effects in these equations. Chapter 8 deals with the complex subject of interference between space and terrestrial systems.",2013-09-05,1987-12-01,/api/citations/19880004844/downloads/19880004844.pdf,/api/citations/19880004844/downloads/19880004844.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A comparison of error probabilities for various message block durations and fade margins as a function of vegetation shadowing,"In order to give vehicles travelling in rural areas of the U.S. access to the telephone network, a Land Mobile Satellite System is being planned. Previously presented data by the author were analyzed for the probability that the received signal level dropped below a threshold during short time blocks of various signal durations and the conditional probability that such an event would reoccur after a given delay. If it assumed that a fade threshold crossing of even 1 msec would produce an error in the transmission, then the derived quantities can be considered error probabilities. Extensive tables and graphs are presented with the results from the analysis. They can be used to devise communication strategies which will provide improved link availability in the presence of vegetation shadowing.",2013-09-05,1985-11-25,/api/citations/19880004873/downloads/19880004873.pdf,/api/citations/19880004873/downloads/19880004873.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Circulation control can provide an aircraft with STOL performance of heavy lift capability. For ship based Naval aircraft the lower takeoff and landing velocities result in reduced deck gear and wind over the deck requirements. Circulation control airfoils can be mechanically less complex and lightweight compared to multi-element high lift airfoils.,2013-09-05,1987-05-01,/api/citations/19880008223/downloads/19880008223.pdf,/api/citations/19880008223/downloads/19880008223.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880008226,AERODYNAMICS,Circulation control STOL aircraft design aspects,"Since Davidson patented Circulation Control Airfoils in 1960, there have been only 2 aircraft designed and flown with circulation control (CC). Designing with CC is complex for the following reasons: the relation between lift increase and blowing momentum is nonlinear; for good cruise performance one must change the wing geometry in flight from a round to a sharp trailing edge. The bleed air from the propulsion engines or an auxiliary compressor, must be used efficiently. In designing with CC, the propulsion and control aspects are just as important as aerodynamics. These design aspects were examined and linearized equations are presented in order to facilitate a preliminary analysis of the performance potential of CC. The thrust and lift requirements for takeoff make the calculated runway length very sensitive to the bleed air ratio. Thrust vectoring improves performance and can offset nose down pitching moments. The choice of blowing jet to free stream velocity ratio determines the efficiency of applying bleed air power.",2013-09-05,1987-05-01,/api/citations/19880008226/downloads/19880008226.pdf,/api/citations/19880008226/downloads/19880008226.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19880008261,"AIRCRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",Transport delay compensation for computer-generated imagery systems,"In the problem of pure transport delay in a low-pass system, a trade-off exists with respect to performance within and beyond a frequency bandwidth. When activity beyond the band is attenuated because of other considerations, this trade-off may be used to improve the performance within the band. Specifically, transport delay in computer-generated imagery systems is reduced to a manageable problem by recognizing frequency limits in vehicle activity and manual-control capacity. Based on these limits, a compensation algorithm has been developed for use in aircraft simulation at NASA Ames Research Center. For direct measurement of transport delays, a beam-splitter experiment is presented that accounts for the complete flight simulation environment. Values determined by this experiment are appropriate for use in the compensation algorithm. The algorithm extends the bandwidth of high-frequency flight simulation to well beyond that of normal pilot inputs. Within this bandwidth, the visual scene presentation manifests negligible gain distortion and phase lag. After a year of utilization, two minor exceptions to universal simulation applicability have been identified and subsequently resolved.",2013-09-05,1988-01-01,/api/citations/19880008261/downloads/19880008261.pdf,/api/citations/19880008261/downloads/19880008261.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The control design scheme utilizes flexibility in eigenvector assignments to reduce control system sensitivity to changes in system parameters. The methods involve use of the singular value decomposition to provide an exact description of allowable eigenvectors in terms of a minimum number of design parameters. In a design example, the methods are applied to the problem of symmetric flutter suppression in an aeroelastic vehicle. In this example the flutter mode is sensitive to changes in dynamic pressure and eigenspace methods are used to enhance the performance of a stabilizing minimum energy/linear quadratic regulator controller and associated observer. Results indicate that the methods provide feedback control laws that make stability of the nominal closed loop systems insensitive to changes in dynamic pressure.",2013-09-05,1988-01-01,/api/citations/19880008300/downloads/19880008300.pdf,/api/citations/19880008300/downloads/19880008300.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The resistojet heater was supplied with power at 20 kHz and low voltage through a power controller. The resistojet was isolated from its power supply in the RFI enclosure, and the magnetic emission measured at three locations around the resistojet at various heater currents. At a heater current of 18.5 A the maximum magnetic emission was 61 dBpt at a distance of 1 m from the resistojet and at a location at the rear of the thruster. Calculations indicate that the case and heat shields provided a minimum of 4 dB of attenuation at a current of 18.5 A. Maximum radiation was measured at the rear of the resistojet along its major axis and was thought to be due to the magnetic radiation from the power leads. At a distance of 37 cm from the resistojet the maximum magnetic radiation measured was 73 dBpt at a current of 11.2 A. The power input leads were also a source of magnetic radiation.

The model consists of equations that relate crater and perforation damage of a multisheet structure to parameters such as projectile size, impact velocity, and trajectory obliquity. The equations are obtained through a regression analysis of oblique hypervelocity impact test data. This data shows that the response of a multisheet structure to oblique impact is significantly different from its response to normal hypervelocity impact.

This was the result of correlating fatigue damage mechanisms and deformation mechanisms operating at elevated temperatures on the basis of observed mechanical and microstructural behavior. Correlation between high temperature fatigue and stress strain properties for nickel base superalloys and stainless steel substantiated the method. Parameters which must be evaluated for PP- and CC- life are the maximum stress achievable under entirely plastic and creep conditions respectively and corresponding inelastic strains, and the elastic modulus. For plasticity/creep interaction conditions (PC and CP) two more pairs of stress strain parameters must be ascertained.",2013-09-05,1988-01-01,/api/citations/19880008656/downloads/19880008656.pdf,/api/citations/19880008656/downloads/19880008656.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The object of this research is to determine how well, or poorly, a single numerical algorithm would map onto three different architectures. The algorithm is a compact difference scheme for the solution of the incompressible, two-dimensional, time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. The computers were chosen so as to encompass a variety of architectures. They are the following: the MPP, an SIMD machine with 16K bit serial processors; Flex/32, an MIMD machine with 20 processors; and Cray/2. The implementation of the algorithm is discussed in relation to these architectures and measures of the performance on each machine are given. The basic comparison is among SIMD instruction parallelism on the MPP, MIMD process parallelism on the Flex/32, and vectorization of a serial code on the Cray/2. Simple performance models are used to describe the performance. These models highlight the bottlenecks and limiting factors for this algorithm on these architectures.

The desire to provide software which allows the user to choose between the often conflicting goals of minimizing central processing unit (CPU) time or storage requirements has led to a diagonal-based algorithm in which one of four types of storage is selected for each diagonal. The candidate storage types employed were chosen to be efficient on the CYBER 205 for diagonals which have nonzero structure which is dense, moderately sparse, very sparse and short, or very sparse and long; however, for many densities, no diagonal type is most efficient with respect to both resource requirements, and a trade-off must be made. For each diagonal, an initialization subroutine estimates the CPU time and storage required for each storage type based on results from previously performed numerical experimentation. These requirements are adjusted by weights provided by the user which reflect the relative importance the user places on the two resources. The adjusted resource requirements are then compared to select the most efficient storage and computational scheme.",2013-09-05,1988-03-01,/api/citations/19880008918/downloads/19880008918.pdf,/api/citations/19880008918/downloads/19880008918.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Moreover, almost any study of ODE systems begins with linear systems. It is remarkable that Hormander's paper on hypoellipticity of second order linear p.d.e.'s starts with equations due to Kolmogorov, which are shown to be analogous to the linear PDEs. Eigenvalue placement by state feedback for a controllable linear system can be paralleled for a Kolmogorov equation if an appropriate type of feedback is introduced. Results concerning transformations of nonlinear systems to linear systems are similar to results for transforming a linear PDE to a Kolmogorov equation.",2013-09-05,1987-01-01,/api/citations/19880008947/downloads/19880008947.pdf,/api/citations/19880008947/downloads/19880008947.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Comparisons between the conventional form of the methods and the leapfrog form are made under the assumption that the number of unknowns is large. In the case of Richardson's method, it is possible to express the final iterate in terms of only the initial approximation, a variant of the iteration called the grand-leap method. In the case of the grand-leap variant, a set of parameters is required. An algorithm is presented to compute these parameters that is related to algorithms to compute the weights and abscissas for Gaussian quadrature. General algorithms to implement the leapfrog and grand-leap methods are presented.

19880012193,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,The Spring 1985 high precision baseline test of the JPL GPS-based geodetic system,"The Spring 1985 High Precision Baseline Test (HPBT) was conducted. The HPBT was designed to meet a number of objectives. Foremost among these was the demonstration of a level of accuracy of 1 to 2:10 to the 7th power, or better, for baselines ranging in length up to several hundred kilometers. These objectives were all met with a high degree of success, with respect to the demonstration of system accuracy in particular. The results from six baselines ranging in length from 70 to 729 km were examined for repeatability and, in the case of three baselines, were compared to results from colocated VLBI systems. Repeatability was found to be 5:10 to the 8th power (RMS) for the north baseline coordinate, independent of baseline length, while for the east coordinate RMS repeatability was found to be larger than this by factors of 2 to 4. The GPS-based results were found to be in agreement with those from colocated VLBI measurements, when corrected for the physical separations of the VLBI and CPG antennas, at the level of 1 to 2:10 to the 7th power in all coordinates, independent of baseline length. The results for baseline repeatability are consistent with the current GPA error budget, but the GPS-VLBI intercomparisons disagree at a somewhat larger level than expected. It is hypothesized that these differences may result from errors in the local survey measurements used to correct for the separations of the GPS and VLBI antenna reference centers.",2013-09-05,1987-11-15,/api/citations/19880012193/downloads/19880012193.pdf,/api/citations/19880012193/downloads/19880012193.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The electron foreshock is characterized by magnetic connection to the cometary bow shock and increased field aligned electron heat flux directed away from the bow shock. A similar region was intermittently encountered by the ICE spacecraft prior to its crossing of the Giacobini-Zinner bow wave. During periods of magnetic connection with the Halley bow shock, enhanced magnetic field fluctuations were observed. These enhancements are interpreted as indirect evidence of an ion foreshock in the electron foreshock.

Computer-generated images of these features illustrate the diversity of patterns that can be explained by varying the position of the spin axis, rotation period, location and extent of the active area, and the ejecta's dynamical constants for a given Sun-Earth-comet geometry. It is shown that an emission fan is generated by rotation of a high-latitude source about the spin axis of the nucleus with a relatively high obliquity, but that the fan's formation is rather insensitive to the rotation period. It appears that at least for comets with perihelia well outside the Earth's orbit, the position angle of a fan's observed axis virtually coincides with the projected direction of the spin axis, thus constraining the spatial orientation of the latter.",2013-09-05,1987-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The approach employed is based on the emission-cone concept formulated for a continuous (or quasi-continuous) collimated flow of dust ejected from discrete active regions on a rotating nucleus. The results show that the observations can be satisfied by assuming an invariable position of the pole, although this is not necessarily the only solution. The derived obliquity of 54 deg and the latitude of +60 deg for the southernmost boundary of the active source imply that the region experiences a polar day for 5 months about perihelion and a polar night for over 3 yr approximately centered on the aphelion point. Combining these results with scattered photometric and spectrophotometric information on the comet at large heliocentric distance, the outbursts observed near 3 AU are attributed to intermittent activity from the region shortly prior and following the polar night.",2013-09-05,1987-09-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

19880015284,"SPACECRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",A feedback linearization approach to spacecraft control using momentum exchange devices,Recent developments in the area of nonlinear control theory have shown how coordiante changes in the state and input spaces can be used with nonlinear feedback to transform certain nonlinear ordinary differential equations into equivalent linear equations. These feedback linearization techniques are applied to resolve two problems arising in the control of spacecraft equipped with control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). The first application involves the computation of rate commands for the gimbals that rotate the individual gyroscopes to produce commanded torques on the spacecraft. The second application is to the long-term management of stored momentum in the system of control moment gyroscopes using environmental torques acting on the vehicle. An approach to distributing control effort among a group of redundant actuators is described that uses feedback linearization techniques to parameterize sets of controls which influence a specified subsystem in a desired way. The approach is adapted for use in spacecraft control with double-gimballed gyroscopes to produce an algorithm that avoids problematic gimbal configurations by approximating sets of gimbal rates that drive CMG rotors into desirable configurations. The momentum management problem is stated as a trajectory optimization problem with a nonlinear dynamical constraint. Feedback linearization and collocation are used to transform this problem into an unconstrainted nonlinear program. The approach to trajectory optimization is fast and robust. A number of examples are presented showing applications to the proposed NASA space station.,2013-09-05,1988-04-01,/api/citations/19880015284/downloads/19880015284.pdf,/api/citations/19880015284/downloads/19880015284.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880015298,SPACECRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Evaluation of the communications impact of a low power arcjet thruster,"The interaction of a 1 kW arcjet thruster plume with a communications signal is evaluated. A two-parameter, source flow equation has been used to represent the far flow field distribution of the arcjet plume in a realistic spacecraft configuration. Modelling the plume as a plasma slab, the interaction of the plume with a 4 GHz communications signal is then evaluated in terms of signal attenuation and phase shift between transmitting and receiving antennas. Except for propagation paths which pass very near the arcjet source, the impacts to transmission appear to be negligible. The dominant signal loss mechanism is refraction of the beam rather than absorption losses due to collisions. However, significant reflection of the signal at the sharp vacuum-plasma boundary may also occur for propagation paths which pass near the source.",2013-09-05,1988-01-01,/api/citations/19880015298/downloads/19880015298.pdf,/api/citations/19880015298/downloads/19880015298.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The concept of positioning a block of electrically conductive material so that its axis is set at a predetermined skew angle with relation to a travelling electron discharge machine electrode and thereafter revolving the body about its own axis to generate a hyperbolic surface of revolution, either internal or external is novel. The method will generate a rocket nozzle which may be provided with cooling channels using the same control and positioning system. The configuration of the cooling channels so produced are unique and novel.

This paper describes a successful technique developed by the Lewis Research Center that starts with the coating of a mandrel and then builds the thrust chamber around it by electroforming appropriate materials.

Two mucopolysaccharides (sodium heparin and chrondroitin sulfate) and two proteins (positively charged lysozyme and negatively charged bovine serum albumin) were studied as adsorbates. The effects of pH, calcium oxalate surface charge (varied by calcium or oxalate ion activity), and citrate concentration were investigated. All four macromolecules showed evidence for chemical adsorption. The macromolecule concentrations needed for reversing the surface charge indicated that the mucopopolysacchrides have greater affinity for the COM surface than the proteins. The amount of proteins that can chemically adsorb appears to be limited to approximately one monomolecular layer. When the surface charge is high, an insufficient number of proteins can chemically adsorb to neutralize or reverse the surface charge. The remaining surface charge is balanced by proteins held near the surface by longer range electrostatic forces only. Citrate ions at high concentrations appear to compete effectively with the negative protein for surface sites but show no evidence for competing with the positively charged protein.",2013-09-05,1988-01-01,/api/citations/19880015407/downloads/19880015407.pdf,/api/citations/19880015407/downloads/19880015407.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The system responds to an externally applied frequency control code which is configured to avoid any confusion between different control modes. A premature detonation routine is entered in case an improper time-setting signal is entered, or if the shell is launched before completion of the time-setting sequence. Special provisions are also made for very early launch situations and improper detonator connections.

A thorough analysis was made of the proper boundary conditions and chemistry kinetics necessary for an accurate computational analysis of the flow environment in the SSME fuel side preburner chamber during the initial startup transient. Pertinent results were presented to facilitate incorporation of these findings into an appropriate CFD code. The computation must be a turbulent computation, since the flow field turbulent mixing will have a profound effect on the chemistry. Because of the additional equations demanded by the chemistry model it is recommended that for expediency a simple algebraic mixing length model be adopted.

Two coefficients in the outer layer eddy viscosity model were determined as functions of Mach number and temperature ratio. By matching the solutions from the Baldwin-Lomax model to those from the Cebeci-Smith model for a flat plate at hypersonic speed, the new values of the coefficient were obtained. The results show that the values of C sub cp and C sub kleb are functions of both Mach number and wall temperature ratio. The C sub cp and C sub kleb variations with Mach number and wall temperature were used for the calculations of both a 4 deg wedge flow at Mach 18 and an axisymmetric Mach 20 nozzle flow. The Navier-Stokes equations with thin layer approximation were solved for the above hypersonic flow conditions and the results were compared with existing experimental data.

It is particularly well suited for releasably connecting structures to be used in the space environment or in other aerospace applications. The device comprises a fastener plate and fastener body, each attachable to either one of a pair of structures to be joined. The fastener plate and the body are fastenable by a toggle supported at one end on the fastener plate and mounted for universal pivotal movement thereon. At its other end, which is received in a central opening in the fastener body and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein, the toggle is restrained by three retractable latching pins. Each pin is individually retractable by combustion of a pyrotechnic charge. While retraction of all three pins releases the toggle, the fastener is mechanically two fault tolerant since the failure of any single or pair of the latch pins to retract results in an asymmetrical loading on the toggle and its pivotal movement to effect a release. An annular bolt is mounted on the fastener plate as a support for the socket mounting of the toggle whereby its selective axial movement provides a means for pre-loading the toggle.",2013-09-05,1988-02-11,/api/citations/19880015585/downloads/19880015585.pdf,/api/citations/19880015585/downloads/19880015585.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Concentrations of CO2 ranged from 150 microM in the Amazon mainstem to 200 to 300 microM in aerobic waters of the floodplain, and up to 1000 microM in oxygen-depleted environments. Apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) ranged from 80 to 250 microM. Methane was highly supersaturated, with concentrations ranging from 0.06 microM in the mainstem to 100 microM on the floodplain. Concentrations of N2O were slightly supersaturated in the mainstem, but were undersaturated on the floodplain. Fluxes calculated from these concentrations indicated decomposition of 1600 g C sq m y(-1) of organic carbon in Amazon floodplain waters. Analysis of relationships between CH4, O2, and CO2 concentrations indicated that approximately 50 percent of carbon mineralization on the floodplain is anaerobic, with 20 percent lost to the atmoshphere as CH4. The predominance of anaerobic metabolism leads to consumption of N2O on the flood plane. Elevated concentrations of CH4 in the mainstem probably reflect imput from the floodplain, while high levels of CO2 in the mainstem are derived from a combination of varzea drainage and in situ respiration.",2013-09-05,1986-01-01,/api/citations/19880015678/downloads/19880015678.pdf,/api/citations/19880015678/downloads/19880015678.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The second is a more fully automated, stand-alone system which will observe and report the full range of weather parameters and will operate primarily in the unattended mode. Approximately 250 systems are planned by the end of the decade. When deployed, these systems will generate the standard hourly and special long-line transmitted weather observations, as well as provide continuous weather information direct to airport users.

A new steady-state theory is introduced that incorporates the effects of convection in dendritic growth. It is shown that in the absence of capillary effects the shape of the crystal-melt interface is a paraboloid of revolution, similar to that found in situations where diffusion is the sole heat transfer mechanism. A relation between the supercooling, the product of the tip velocity and tip radius, and the strength of the flow is derived which reduces to the well-known Ivantsov theory in the absence of convection. A non-linear interface-tracking algorithm is developed and used to study the temporal and spatial evolution of the dendritic interface. The important role of capillarity and convection on the interface dynamics is established and the response of the interface to finite amplitude disturbances is examined for the first time. Tip splitting is identified as the dominant destabilization mechanism in the limit of zero surface tension. Finite surface tension leads to interface stabilization, irrespective of the magnitude and structure of the external perturbations.

For Teflon, typical pulse durations are 2-3 ns, rise and fall times are sometimes as low as 0.2 ns, current amplitudes are approximately 100 mA flowing down to the pedestal and the pulses are unidirectional with no ringing. The use of a rapid-scan electron microscope with a secondary-electron imaging system reveals complex charge distributions resembling Lichtenberg figures on a supposedly flat homogeneous dielectric surface. These patterns undergo extensive alteration at each micro-discharge pulse and indicate that both the charging and discharging processes are highly nonuniform over the dielectric surface.

The total event lasted for 30 minutes and was made up of a number of superimposed individual events. At the time, the spacecraft was in the outer magnetosphere about 7 R sub J below the magnetic equator. Before and after the event, the proton flux was characteristic of the low flux level normally encountered between crossings of the magnetic equator. Flux changes at different energies were coherent within 1 minute; a time comparable to the time resolution of the data. The angular distributions were highly anisotropic with protons streaming towards Jupiter. A field-aligned dumbbell distribution was observed initially, and a pancake distribution just before the flux decayed to its pre-event value. The alpha particle flux changed as rapidly as the proton flux but peaked at different times.

First, the contribution of aircraft to the local air pollution of metropolitan areas and, second, the long-term effects on the chemical balance of the stratosphere of pollutants emitted from future generations of high-altitude, supersonic commercial and military aircraft. Preliminary findings indicate that stratospheric oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions may have to be limited to very low levels if, for example, ozone depletion with concomitant increases in sea-level radiation, are to be avoided. Theoretical considerations suggest that (NOx) levels as low as 1.0 gram per kilogram of fuel and less should be attainable from a idealized premixed type of combustor.

Insertion of an oxygen atom onto the tertiary carbon transforming the isobutane into tertiary butanol occurred first. This step implied the photonic formation of the 02- species and its reaction with positive holes. The tertiary butanol was then dehydrated to isobutene which is oxidized acetone and carbon dioxide.

These measurements were made in conjunction with Auger spectroscopy so that the secondary emission characteristics could be determined as a function of surface contamination or purity. The results show that low atomic weight elements, such as beryllium and carbon, have the lowest reflected primary yield and that roughening the surface of an electrode can markedly decrease secondary yield both for delta and reflected primaries.

Important assets which urge the selection of the capuchin monkey for space experiments include his small size, high intelligence, relative disease resistance, nutritional requirements, and lower volume life support systems. The species is particularly suited for experiments on the nervous system or on process under neural control because of the similarity of capuchin and human blood chemistry profiles and endocrine systems involved in the maintenance of homeostasis and vasomotor tone.",2013-08-09,1977-09-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In such models, the scale perpendicular to the plane has a strong effect in determining the distribution of cosmic rays. Radial distributions were calculated for cylindrical coordinate models. The implied gamma-ray longitude distributions were then calculated and compared with the SAS-2 data. Assuming the sources to be supernova remnants or pulsars, only cosmic-ray nucleon halo models with an upper limit scale height of about 3 kpc provide a good fit to the gamma ray data.

For energies above 100 MeV the gamma ray results are consistent with an equation of the form I(b)=C1+C2/sin b with the second term being dominant, suggesting that the radiation above 100 MeV comes largely from the local regions of the galactic disk. Between 35 and 100 MeV, a similar equation is also a reasonable representation of the data, but here the two terms are comparable, with the first, or isotropic term, actually being the larger one. In addition to indicating that the diffuse radiation is partially galactic, these results imply a steepness for the energy spectrum of the diffuse isotropic component which places significant constraints on possible theoretical models of this radiation.",2013-08-09,1977-07-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In the context of an open universe model, the value of omega which best fits the present gamma-ray data is omega equals approx. 0.1 which does not conflict with upper limits on Comptonization distortion of the 3K background radiation.

Flap configurations of the generator that shed multiple vortices were found to have wakes that dispersed by vortex merging and sinusoidal instability. Reductions of approximately 50 percent in both the wake rolling moment imposed on a following aircraft and the aircraft separation requirement were achieved in the ground based and flight test experiments by deflecting the trailing edge flaps more inboard than outboard. Significantly, this configuration did not increase the drag or vibration on the generating aircraft compared to the conventional landing configuration. Ground based results of rolling moment measurement and flow visualization are shown, using a water tow facility, an air tow facility, and a wind tunnel.

19780004563,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,"The application of LANDSAT-1 imagery for monitoring strip mines in the new river watershed in northeast Tennessee, part 2","The author has identified the following significant results. LANDSAT imagery and supplementary aircraft photography of the New River drainage basin were subjected to a multilevel analysis using conventional photointerpretation methods, densitometric techniques, multispectral analysis, and statistical tests to determine the accuracy of LANDSAT-1 imagery for measuring strip mines of common size. The LANDSAT areas were compared with low altitude measurements. The average accuracy over all the mined land sample areas mapped from LANDSAT-1 was 90%. The discrimination of strip mine subcategories is somewhat limited on LANDSAT imagery. A mine site, whether active or inactive, can be inferred by lack of vegetation, by shape, or image texture. Mine ponds are difficult or impossible to detect because of their small size and turbidity. Unless bordered and contrasted with vegetation, haulage roads are impossible to delineate.

In the suite of low-KREEP highland rocks, Fe/(Fe + Mg) in the normative mafic minerals increases and the albite content of normative plagio-clase decreases as the total amount of normative plagioclase increases, the opposite of the trend predicted by the Bowen reaction principle. The distribution of compositions of rocks from terrestrial layered mafic intrusives is substantially different: here the analyses fall in several discrete clusters (anorthositic rocks, norites, granophyres and ferrogabbros, ultramafics), and the chemical trends noted above are not reproduced. It is suggested that the observed trends in lunar highland rocks could be produced by crystal fractionation in a deep global surface magma system if (1) plagiociase tended to float, upon crystallization, and (2) the magma was kept agitated and well mixed (probably by thermal convection) until crystallization was far advanced and relatively little residual liquid was left.

That is, about half of the basaltic fragments in the large size fractions in zone 2001 are of a specific porphyritic breccia-like type. Anorthositic fragments containing a notable amount of metallic iron are basically limited to zone 2004 and probably explain the lower concentrations of Ce, Rb, Ba, La, and perhaps Co in this zone. The high concentrations of Ag and Ce found previously are confirmed. Although Ag is at nearly the same concentration in all four zones of the core, Cd in the core is the result of local enrichment.

Emphasis is given to methodical problems and the geological interpretation of lunar rock ages. Often it is ambigious to associate a given lunar breccia with a certain formation, or a formation with a basin. In addition, large-scale events on the Moon have not necessarily reset radiometric clocks completely. One rock fragment has a well-defined plateau age of 4.28 b.y., but the ages of two Apollo 17 breccias define an upper limit for the formation age of the Serenitatis basin at 4.05 b.y. Ages derived from five mare basalts indicate cessation of mare volcanism at Taurus-Littrow approximately 3.78 b.y. ago. Ca/Ar-37 exposure ages show that Camelot Crater was formed by an impact approximately 95 m.y. ago. After a short summary of the lunar timetable as it stands at the end of the Apollo program, we report about Ar-39/Ar-40 and rare gas studies on the Malvern meteorite. This achondrite resembles lunar highland breccias in texture as well as in rare-gas patterns. It was strongly annealed at some time between 3.4 and 3.8 b.y. ago. The results indicate that very similar processes have occurred on the Moon and on achondritic parent bodies at comparable times, leading to impact breccias with strikingly similar features, including the retention of rare-gas isotopes from various sources.",2013-08-09,1977-01-01,/api/citations/19780005017/downloads/19780005017.pdf,/api/citations/19780005017/downloads/19780005017.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780005015

The brightness of the fields of the calibration plate were measured in preliminary studies, relative to the brightness of a magnesia screen. This permitted determination of the reflectance features of the surficial lunar material relative to the standard most widely used in brightness studies of natural substances. The total brightness of sections a few centimeters across was recorded in direct proximity to the apparatus. The total area investigated in one panorama was about one square meter. Several areas in the mare and highland regions were studied. The albedos of various surface objects were obtained. A comparison of the brightness measurements with data from the RIFMA-M instrument discloses a correlation of the albedo change with change in chemical composition of the surface rock.

19780005035,ASTROPHYSICS,Chemical fractionation in the solar nebula,"The sequence of condensation of minerals from a cooling gas of solar composition has been calculated from thermodynamic data over the pressure range 0.001-0.00001 atm, assuming that complete chemical equilibrium is maintained. The results suggest that the Ca-Al-rich inclusions Allende and other carbonaceous chondrites are aggregates of the highest temperature condensates. Complete condensation of these elements is followed, 100 deg later, by the onset of the crystallization of nickel-iron, forsterite and enstatite. Transport of Ca-Al-rich refractory condensates from one part of the nebula to another before the condensation of these lower-temperature phases may have been responsible for the refractory element fractionations between the different classes of chondrites and possibly for the inferred refractory element enrichment of the Moon. The temperature gap between the condensation temperatures of nickel-iron and forsterite increases with increasing total pressure. Because pressure and temperature probably increased with decreasing heliocentric distance in the solar nebula, Mercury may have accreted from a condensate assemblage having a higher metal/silicate ratio than Venus or Earth which may, in turn, have formed from less oxidized material than Mars.",2013-08-09,1977-07-01,/api/citations/19780005035/downloads/19780005035.pdf,/api/citations/19780005035/downloads/19780005035.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780005015
19780005039,ASTROPHYSICS,Formation and composition of the moon,"Many of the properties of the Moon, including the enrichment in Ca, Al, Ti, U, Th, Ba, Sr, and the REE and the depletion in Fe, Rb, K, Na, and other volatiles can be understood if the Moon represents a high-temperature condensate from the solar nebula. Thermodynamic calculations show that Ca-, Al-, and Ti-rich compounds condense first in a cooling nebula. The initial high temperature mineralogy is gehlenite, spinel, perovskite, Ca-Al-rich pyroxenes, and anorthite. Inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites such as the Allende meteorite are composed primarily of these minerals and, in addition, are highly enriched in refractories such as REE relative to carbonaceous chondrites. These inclusions can yield basalt and anorthosite in the proportions required to eliminate the europium anomaly, leaving a residual spinel-melilite interior. A deep interior high in Ca-Al does not imply an unacceptable mean density or moment of inertia for the Moon. The inferred high-U content of the lunar interior, both from the Allende analog and the high heat flow, indicates a high-temperature interior. The model is consistent with extensive early melting, with shallow melting at 3 AE, and with presently high deep internal temperatures. It is predicted that the outer 250 km is rich in plagioclase and FeO. The low iron content of the interior in this model raises the interior temperatures estimated from electrical conductivity by some 800 C.",2013-08-09,1977-01-01,/api/citations/19780005039/downloads/19780005039.pdf,/api/citations/19780005039/downloads/19780005039.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780005015

19780005556,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,"Investigations of spectral separability of small grains, early season wheat detection, and multicrop inventory planning","The author has identified the following significant results. LANDSAT data from seven 5 by 6 segments having crop type information were analyzed to determine the potential for spectral separation of spring wheat from other small grains as an alternative to the primary LACIE procedure for estimating spring wheat acreage. Within segment field-center, classification accuracies for spring wheat vs. barley tended to be best in mid-July when crop color changes were in progress. When correlations were made for differences in atmospheric haze, data from several segments could be aggregated, and results that approached within segment accuracies were obtained for selected dates. LACIE field measurement spectral reflectance data provided information on both wheat development patterns and the importance of various agronomic factors on wheat reflectance, the most important being availability of soil moisture. To investigate early season detection for winter wheat, reflectance of developing wheat patterns was simulated through reflectance modeling and was analyzed along with field measured reflectance from a Kansas site. The green component development of the wheat field was analyzed as a function of data throughout the season. A selected threshold was not crossed by all fields until mid-April. These reflectance data were shown to be consistent actual LANDSAT data.",2013-09-03,1977-11-01,/api/citations/19780005556/downloads/19780005556.pdf,/api/citations/19780005556/downloads/19780005556.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

On landing, 65 percent of postflight leg volume increase was complete at 1.5 h. Measurement of the dominant leg during the equivalent period on Shuttle showed a mean loss of 0.9 l which was 90-percent complete at 150 min. Postflight increases were 87-percent complete at 1.5 h postlanding. Mass measurements during and after Skylab 4 showed a loss of 2.5 kg over the first 4 d on orbit, with a gain of 2.7 kg over the first 4 d of recovery. These changes are assumed to be tissue fluids secondary to changes in hydrostatic pressures and are much greater than those seen in bed rest.

19880025778,METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,An analytical solution to obtain the optimum source location using multiple direction finders on a spherical surface,"An analytical solution is presented for determining the optimum location of a radiating source on the surface of a sphere, given multiple bearings. The bearings are assumed to have small errors of the order of 0-10 deg. The optimum location is found by minimizing the sum of the squares of the perpendicular great-circle distances from the source to the bearing lines. This is achieved analytically through an eigenvalue approach, rather than the usual iterative, numerical approach. Bearings of different weight are taken into account by approximating the distance from each direction finder to the source. The result is general and may have wide application. Since it is simple and nearly as fast as the triangulation technique for source location, it is now used in the SUNY-Albany East Coast Lightning Detection Network to compute the optimum location for lightning in real time.",2013-08-13,1987-09-20,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Two of these particles contain hibonite, perovskite, spinel, refractory glass, and a melilite; only hibonite was identified within a third. The grain size for all particles ranges from 0.05 to 1 micrometer, so that they are much finer grained than the refractory calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions in meteorites.

Twenty participants controlled GT-MSOCC, a high-fidelity simulation of the operator interface to a NASA ground control system, via a workstation equipped with either a single keyboard or a voice-augmented keyboard. Experimental results showed that in all cases where significant performance differences occurred, performance with the voice-augmented keyboard modality was inferior to and had greater variance than the keyboard-only modality.

These oligomers have been found to undergo 'self-crosslinking' reactions upon heating above 220 C, via the reaction of the terminal amine groups with the in-chain keto carbonyl functionalities. The resulting networks are ductile, chemically resistant, and nonporous. The networks obtained via generated ketimine functionality were characterized by solid state NMR. They have also been found to be remarkably stable toward hydrolysis. Ketimine functional bishalide monomers have also been synthesized. Such monomers have been utilized to synthesize a wide variety of amorphous poly(arylene ether) ketimine polymers. A high molecular weight hydroquinone functional poly(arylene ether) ketimine has been acid treated to regenerate a poly(arylene ether ketone) backbone in solution.

Utilizing PMR methodology, neat resin moldings were prepared with various monomer reactants and screened for thermo-oxidative stability at 371 C (700 F) under both ambient and a four-atmosphere air pressure. The results of the resin screening studies indicate that high molecular weight (HMW) formulated resins of first (PMR-15) and second (PMR-II) generation PMR materials exhibit lower levels of weight loss at 371 C (700) than PMR-15 and PMR-II resins. The resin systems which exhibited the best overall balance of processability, Tg and thermo-oxidative stability at 371 C were used to prepare unidirectional Celion 6000 and T-40R graphite fiber laminates. Laminates were evaluated for thermo-oxidative stability and 371 C mechanical properties. Results of the laminate evaluation studies indicate that two of the resin compositions have potential for use in 371 C applications.

It was found that relatively large amounts of Te must be added to the melt to achieve lattice matching because of its low segregation coefficient relative to Se.

This represents an important new 'window' for the study of extragalactic systems with low surface brightness. Taking into account the UV/V energy distributions of potential targets, it is found that in certain favorable circumstances UV photometry may permit the detection of regions with equivalent V band surface brightness as low as 35 mag/sq arcsec, or over 100,000 times fainter than the ground-based sky.",2013-08-13,1987-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Limits on the luminosities of possible white dwarf companions provide lower limits of 2-5x10 to the 8th yr to the ages of any degenerate companions. All five stars exhibit strong Tc I lines, and the presence of technetium, with a half-life of 2.1x10 to the 5th yr, signifies recent nucleosynthesis. The limits on the ages of possible white dwarf companions that are equal to or greater than 1000 half-lives of Tc exclude the possibility that the s-process elemental enhancement seen in these MS and S stars resulted from mass transfer from a more highly evolved companion (as is probably the mechanism by which barium stars are created).

The UV continuum flux distributions are generally flatter than systems of low inclination and high mass-transfer rate, and the white dwarfs/inner disk appear to be relatively cool (15,000-19,000 K) for their orbital periods, possibly because the boundary layers are blocked from view. The continuum fluxes increase at spot phases, with the spot providing the dominant flux in IP Peg. The spot temperatures range from hot (20,000 K) in IP Peg, and perhaps in PG 1030+590, to cool (11,000 K) in V1315 Aql.

These models are consistent with eclipse observation by Dunbar and Tedesco (1986) but not with Reinsch and Pakull (1987). The most likely model for Charon is the standard asteroid model, typical for the icy Galilean and Saturnian satellites. Charon models with a significant atmosphere can be ruled out. Based on currently available radius and albedo constraints, no significant numerical distinction is possible between Pluto models ranging from isothermal spheres with surface emissivity between 0.4 and 0.9. Concerns regarding the viability of an emissivity as low as 0.4 favor the higher-emissivity models. The globally uniform surface temperature of Pluto may thus at present be as low as 45 K, with a methane column abundance of 6.7 cm atm.

The bending stiffness of the column appears in the expression for the Euler load along with the column length, therefore the experimental data allows a direct computation of bending stiffness.

The distinctive attributes of these induced motions are particularly evident in the Michigan State Univerity Free Shear Flow Facility since the total test section length (3m) is nominally the same as the location of the first, fully formed, coherent motion, ca/x theta (0) = 400 (or 2.5 m). Hence, detailed studies of the induced motions can be executed. Individual coherent motions are identified by the induced velocity signatures and conditional-ensemble statistics are used to represent the irrotational field properties.

The results from a large number of time steps were analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform techniques to identify the important frequency components for comparison with published experimental data. A strong low-frequency component was found below the vortex shedding frequency and not harmonically related to it. The experimentally discovered low-frequency fluctuations in the cylinder wake are considered possibly to be precursors to transition from laminar to turbulent flow conditions. The present finding of similar frequencies in a computed wake tends to confirm their existence as a real wake phenomenon.

The complete form of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is used, and the algorithm is second-order accurate in both space and time. The development with time of the shape and size of the separated vortical flow region is computed, as well as the time-variation of several boundary layer parameters and profile shapes. Computations, in general, show excellent agreement with experiment, although the present method predicts a more rapid onset of reversed flow on the cylinder than evidenced in experiment. The changes that the vortical region behind the cylinder undergoes as the symmetric flow transitions to periodic vortex shedding are discussed. The flow becomes periodic with a Strouhal frequency of 0.222, which compares well with the experimental value of approximately 0.21.

The primary limitation of the method is shown to be turbulent water vapor fluctuations. Secondary atmospheric effects caused by diffraction from small refractive-index inhomogeneities and differential refraction for the observation of stars away from zenith are shown to introduce errors that behave as white noise and which should not be significant. Other potential error sources due to photon noise, systematic instrumental effects, and imperfect data reduction are also considered. The improvement in accuracy possible with the two-color method is estimated as a factor of 5-10 over the corresponding one-color measurement. Some preliminary two-color measurements with the Mark III stellar interferometer at Mt.

A positive gradient of approximately 350% per AU is found between .3 AU and 1 AU. Between 1 AU and some 3-5 AU, the gradient is variable with an average value of 100% per AU which is consistent with earlier statistical results. A comparison between measurements at 9 AU and approximately 4 AU shows a negative gradient which is variable from -40 to -100% per AU. Possible solar latitudinal effects on these gradient studies are also discussed. Using solar wind and magnetic field data from Helios 1 between 1 AU and .3 AU, the relation between corotating energetic particle events in the inner solar system and the interplanetary medium is examined.

All of the experimental concepts consisted of plasma-sprayed yttria stabilized ZrO2 on the high temperature side of the blade tip seal shroud.

Scale model inlets were tested in the Lewis Research Center's V/STOL wind tunnel. The effects of centerbody position, entry lip contraction ratio, diffuser length, and diffuser area ratio on inlet total pressure recovery, distortion, and noise suppression were investigated at static conditions and at forward velocity and angle of attack. With the centerbody in the takeoff position (retracted), good aerodynamic and acoustic performance was attained at static conditions and at forward velocity. At 0 deg incidence angle with a sound pressure level reduction of 20 dB, the total pressure recovery was 0.986. Pressure recovery at 50 deg was 0.981. With the centerbody in the approach position (extended), diffuser flow separation occurred at an incidence angle of approximately 20 deg. However, good performance was attained at lower angles. With the centerbody in the takeoff position the ability of the inlet to tolerate high incidence angles was improved by increasing the lip contraction ratio. However, at static conditions with the centerbody in the approach position, an optimum lip contraction ratio appears to exist, with both thinner and thicker lips yielding reduced performance.",2013-09-03,1978-02-01,/api/citations/19780010055/downloads/19780010055.pdf,/api/citations/19780010055/downloads/19780010055.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Unsteady pressure distributions were measured using a blade instrumented with a series miniature pressure transducers. The influence of several geometrical and flow parameters - rotor/stator spacing, stator solidity and stator incidence angle - were studied to determine the unsteady response of the stator to these parameters. A major influence on the stator unsteady response is due to the stator solidity. At high solidities the blade-to-blade interference has a larger contribution. While the range of rotor/stator spacings investigated had a minor influence, the effect of stator incidence angle is significant.

Preliminary results indicate that the relationship between window vibration and aircraft noise is: (1) linear, with vibration levels being accurately predicted from OASPL levels measured near the window; (2) consistent from flyover to flyover for a given aircraft type under approach conditions; (3) no different for Concorde than for other conventional jet transports (in the case of window vibrations induced under approach power conditions); and (4) relatively high levels of window vibration measured during Concorde operations are due more to higher OASPL levels than to unique Concorde source characteristics.",2013-09-03,1978-01-01,/api/citations/19780010930/downloads/19780010930.pdf,/api/citations/19780010930/downloads/19780010930.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Tests of the heat transport capability were greater than or equal to the analytical predictions for the no gas case. When gas was added, the pipe performance degraded by 18% at zero tilt as was expected. The placement of the reservoir heater and the test fixture cooling fins are believed to have caused a superheated vapor condition in the reservoir. Erroneously high reservoir temperature indications resulted from this condition. The observed temperature gradients in the reservoir lend support to this theory. The net result was higher than predicted reservoir temperatures. Also, significant increases in minimum heat load resulted for controller set point temperatures higher than 0 C. At 30 C, control within the tolerance band was maintained, but high reservoir heater power was required. Analyses showed that control is not possible for reasonably low reservoir heater power.

The technique was able to achieve a goal of simultaneously identifying the zero-order fringe and determining the direction of motion (or displacement). Basically, the technique involves the addition of one more exposure, during the loading of the tested object, to the conventional double-exposure hologram. A phase shifter is added to either the object beam or the reference beam during the second and third exposure. Theoretical analysis with the assistance of computer simulation illustrated the feasibility of implementing the phase modulation and triple-exposure in the HNDT systems. Main advantages of the technique are the enhancement of accuracy in data interpretation and a better determination of the nature of the flaws in the tested object.",2013-09-03,1978-02-01,/api/citations/19780011527/downloads/19780011527.pdf,/api/citations/19780011527/downloads/19780011527.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A large set of LANDSAT 2 data, obtained at San Diego, showed excellent linear relationships, particularly for MSS 5 and MSS 6, between the radiance over the ocean and the atmospheric aerosol content. Two other data points obtained at Adrigole, Ireland, representing a different ocean and a different ground truth instrument, showed very good agreement with the San Diego data. It appeared that the technique could be used for global monitoring of the atmospheric aerosol content over the oceans. Results obtained at several inland bodies of water showed that MSS 4, MSS 5, and MSS 6 cannot be used due to the effect of water pollution generally present. However, the LANDSAT 1 results suggested that MSS 7, which operates at longer wavelengths, was not very sensitive to water pollution, and might be useful for inland measurements of aerosol content. Use of the longer wavelength would also minimize the effects of adjacent high albedo land, since atmospheric scattering was reduced at longer wavelengths.",2013-09-03,1978-01-27,/api/citations/19780011632/downloads/19780011632.pdf,/api/citations/19780011632/downloads/19780011632.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In the absence of snow cover, ESMR-5 brightness temperatures were compared with computed upper soil zone moisture values from a soil moisture budgeting scheme. The study was conducted over the U.S. Great Plains for the late summer and early fall in 1974 and 1975.

The onset of condensation effects were found to correlate more with the amount of supercooling in the free stream than it did with the supercooling in the region of maximum local Mach number over the airfoil. Effects in the pressure distribution over the airfoil were generally seen to appear over its entire length at nearly the same total temperature. Both observations suggest the possibility of heterogeneous nucleation occurring in the free stream. The potential operational benefits of the supercooling realized are presented in terms of increased Reynolds number capability at a given tunnel total pressure, reduced drive fan power if Reynolds number is held constant, and reduced liquid nitrogen consumption if Reynolds number is again constant. Depending on total pressure and free stream Mach number, these three benefits are found to respectively vary from 7 to 19%, 11 to 25%, and 9 to 20%.",2013-09-03,1978-03-01,/api/citations/19780012131/downloads/19780012131.pdf,/api/citations/19780012131/downloads/19780012131.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A cyclic procedure has been developed for representation of adjacent blade-to-blade passages which asymptotically achieves the correct phase between all passages of a stage. A shock-capturing finite difference method is employed in the interior of the passage, and a method of characteristics technique is used at the boundaries. The blade slipstreams form two of the passage boundaries and are treated as moving contact surfaces capable of supporting jumps in entropy and tangential velocity. The Kutta condition is imposed by requiring the slipstreams to originate at the trailing edges, which are assumed to be sharp. Results are presented for several transonic fan rotors and compared with available experimental data, consisting of holographic observations of shock structure and pressure contour maps.

Comparisons of the relative performance of each analysis technique are made for the characterization of acoustic emission pulses recorded by a measuring system. To demonstrate the relative sensitivity of each of the methods to small changes in the pulse shape, signatures of computer modeled systems with analytical pulses are presented. Optimization techniques are developed and used to indicate the best design parameter values for deconvolution of the pulse shape. Several experiments are presented that test the pulse signature analysis methods on different acoustic emission sources. These include acoustic emission associated with (a) crack propagation, (b) ball dropping on a plate, (c) spark discharge, and (d) defective and good ball bearings.

The range of advancing tip Mach numbers were between 0.72 to 0.96, and the advance ratios were from 0.2 to 0.375.

Above an advancing tip Mach number of about 0.89, a distinct acoustical pulse can be observed, which dominates the acoustical waveform. The pulse shape is symmetric at moderate tip Mach number, changing to a sawtooth shape at high advancing tip Mach numbers.

The hexagon shaped cracking and fracturing of silicon carbide that occurred is believed to be due to cleavages of both the prismatic and basal planes. The silicon carbide wear debris, which was produced by brittle fracture, slides or rolls on both the metal and silicon carbide and produces grooves and indentations on these surfaces. The wear scars of aluminum and titanium, which have much stronger chemical affinity for silicon and carbon, are generally rougher than those of the other metals.

Retrodirectivity is the result of phase conjugation of the pilot signal received by each element of the array. The problem of supplying the correct phase reference to the phase conjugation circuit (PCC) associated with each element of the array is solved by central phasing. By eliminating the need for structural rigidity, central phasing confers a decisive advantage on ARA's as large spaceborne antennas. A new form of central phasing suitable for very large arrays is described. ARA's may easily be modified to serve both as transmitting and receiving arrays simultaneously. Two new kinds of exact, frequency translating PCC's are described. Such PCC's provide the ARA with input-output isolation and freedom from squint. The pointing errors caused by the radial and transverse components of the ARA's velocity, by the propagation medium, and by multipath are discussed.

With the application of stereo-photogrammetric methods in the air-water system it was possible to investigate the flow processes qualitatively and quantitatively. In the case of a concave wall of sufficient curvature, a primary instability occurs first in the form of Goertler vortices with wave lengths depending upon the boundary layer thickness and the wall curvature. At the onset the amplification rate is in agreement with the linear theory. Later, during the non-linear amplification stage, periodic spanwise vorticity concentrations develop in the low velocity region between the longitudinal vortices.

The present paper incorporates the solutions to investigate the effect of eccentricity on the rotordynamic coefficients. The analysis begins with a set of governing equations based on a turbulent bulk-flow model and Moody's friction factor equation. Perturbations of the flow variables yields a set of zeroth- and first-order equations. After integration of the zeroth-order equations, the resulting zeroth-order flow variables are used as input in the solution of the first-order equations. Further integration of the first order pressures yields the eccentric rotordynamic coefficients.

19880036205,ASTROPHYSICS,In-situ observations of a bi-modal ion distribution in the outer coma of comet P/Halley,"Observations obtained by the Johnstone Plasma Analyzer on the Giotto fly-by of comet Halley showed a fairly sudden decrease in the count rate of energetic (about 30 KeV) water-group ions inside about 500,000 km from the nucleus. This decrease was accompanied by the appearance of a new water-group ion population at slightly lower energies (less than 10 KeV). Close inspection reveals that this lower-energy peak was also present somewhat earlier in the postshock flow but only became prominent near the sudden transition just described. It is shown that the observed bimodal ion distribution is well explained in terms of the velocity history of the accreting solar wind flow in the outer coma. The decline in count rate of the energetic pick-up distribution is due to a relatively sudden slowing of the bulk flow there and not to a loss of particles. Hence, charge-exchange cooling of the flow is probably not important at these distances from the nucleus. The observations suggest that pitch-angle scattering is fairly efficient at least after the bow shock, but that energy diffusion is probably not very efficient.",2013-08-13,1987-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

For parallel propagation, the mode is left-hand circularly polarized, might be unstable in a frequency range containing Omega(i), and moves in the direction of the newborn ion drift along the static magnetic field.",2013-08-13,1987-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

From IUE spectra of comet Halley, upper limits on SH and CS(+) column densities and estimates of probable NO, S2, and SO are found. In particular, judged from the 226-nm gamma band, NO was relatively abundant at 2-8 x 10 to the 13th/sq cm on March 9-14. The production rate of S2 was around 1 x 10 to the 27th molecules/s at that time, but both showed day-to-day variability by 2-3 times.",2013-08-13,1987-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Water production rates obtained from the H data rose from 3.3 x 10 to the 29th/s at 1 AU inbound to 1.2 x 10 to the 30th/s at perihelion; there was a further increase to 1.6 x 10 to the 30th/s followed by a slow decline to 1.4 x 10 to the 30th/s at the time of the Vega-1 encounter. The H measurements show a periodic behavior that imply variations in the water production rate having structure within a 7.4-day sidereal period, in phase with similar variations seen in radical and dust production in March and April.

19880036232,ASTROPHYSICS,Evidence for methane and ammonia in the coma of comet P/Halley,"Methane and ammonia abundances in the coma of Halley are derived from Giotto ion mass spectrometer data using an Eulerian model of chemical and physical processes inside the contact surface to simulate Giotto high-intensity spectrometer ion mass spectral data for mass-to-charge ratios (m/q) from 15 to 19. The ratio m/q = 19/18 as a function of distance from the nucleus is not reproduced by a model for a pure water coma. It is necessary to include the presence of NH3, and uniquely NH3, in coma gases in order to explain the data. A ratio of production rates Q(NH3)/Q(H2O) = 0.01 = 0.02 results in model values approximating the Giotto data. Methane is identified as the most probable source of the distinct peak at m/q = 15. The observations are fit best with Q(CH4)/Q(Q2O) = 0.02. The chemical composition of the comet nucleus implied by these production rate ratios is unlike that of the outer planets.

The emission bands of OH, NH, CN, C3, and C2 were isolated, along with continuum points at 3650 A and 4845 A. All observed species showed pronounced asymmetry about perihelion, with preperihelion abundances being greater by more than a factor of 2 than postperihelion abundances over the heliocentric distance range of 1.0-1.5 AU. The characteristics of the asymmetry were significantly different than observed in previous apparitions, with the peak production rates occurring in late July/early August. The unusually low C2/CN abundance ratio seen in previous apparitions is confirmed by the present observations. Furthermore, the QH data demonstrate that the C2 in Giacobini-Zinner (along with C3 and NH) is depleted when compared to water (the dominant species), rather than CN being unusually over abundant.",2013-08-13,1987-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

A more subtle change in the shape of the nebula also occurred in that a small region, formerly only prominent in the infrared, is now the brightest part of the reflection nebula in visible red light.

The far-infrared fluxes of three highly polarized objects ('blazars') appeared to vary by up to a factor of 2 on time scales of a few months. No convincing cases of variability greater than about 15 percent (rms) were found in any of the normal quasars or Seyfert galaxies studied.

The discontinuities are a consequence of the continuous shuffling and intermixing of the footpoints of the bipolar field by the turbulent photospheric granules. The X-ray corona within the bipolar field is presumed to be a consequence of the continuing dissipation by reconnection at these discontinuities. A flare results when static deformation and/or internal agitation of the field stimulates the onset of rapid reconnection at the many small internal discontinuities. The discontinuities are partially exhausted by the flare, so that the post-flare X-ray emission of that particular loop is substantially below the pre-flare level for a period of some hours while the discontinuities are being rejuvenated.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

II - Baroclinic two-layer models,Previous results based on low- and intermediate-order truncations of the two-layer model suggest the existence of multiple equilibria and/or multiple weather regimes for the extratropical large-scale flow. The importance of the transient waves in the synoptic scales in organizing the large-scale flow and in the maintenance of weather regimes was emphasized. The result shows that multiple equilibria/weather regimes that are present in lower-order models examined disappear when a sufficient number of modes are kept in the spectral expansion of the solution to the governing partial differential equations. Much of the chaotic behavior of the large-scale flow that is present in intermediate-order models is now found to be spurious. Physical reasons for the drastic modification are offered. A peculiarity in the formulation of most existing two-layer models is noted that also tends to exaggerate the importance of baroclinic processes and increase the degree of unpredictability of the large-scale flow.,2013-08-13,1987-11-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The spiral plus dwarf sample forms a continuous but nonhomologous sequence. Indicative dynamical mass-to-light ratios are relatively constant throughout; hydrogen mass-to-light ratios show only a slight increase with decreasing luminosity. The Tully-Fisher relations extend with continuous slope from spirals through dwarfs. The dwarfs show some evidence of ram-pressure stripping by the intracluster medium, but as a group do not seem to be stripped more heavily than spirals.

An optimization process is developed which uses added lumped masses on the structure as design variables to move the node to a preselected location - for example, where low response amplitude is required or to a point which makes the mode shape nearly orthogonal to the force distribution, thereby minimizing the generalized force. The optimization formulation leads to values for added masses that adjust a nodal location while minimizing the total amount of added mass required to do so. As an example, the node of the second mode of a cantilever box beam is relocated to coincide with the centroid of a prescribed force distribution, thereby reducing the generalized force substantially without adding excessive mass. A comparison with an optimization formulation that directly minimizes the generalized force indicates that nodal placement gives essentially a minimum generalized force when the node is appropriately placed.",2013-08-13,1987-12-08,,,CDMS,OTHER,

A simplified receiver for these spread spectrum MSK signals is found, which takes into consideration the effect of random phase perturbations. The performance of these demodulators is evaluated using transfer function bounds for the bit error probability. It is shown that with a reasonable short overlay period, at a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (13 dB), there is a small (0.7 dB) loss of performance.

Lap shear strengths were determined at RT, 177, 204, and 232 C. The adhesive was also characterized after fracture by determining the glass transition temperature as well as defining the mode of failure by visual observation. In general, the results indicate that the TPI(MTC)/H2O retains high lap shear strengths after thermal exposure but had reduced strengths after the water-boil exposure. All failures were cohesive. The TPI(MTC)/H2O compared very well with previous data reported for the standard polyamic-acid/diglyme LARC-TPI results, and therefore, shows promise as a water-soluble adhesive for use in various applications.",2013-08-13,1988-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

IV - Reconstructed images of 4 Vesta,"The images of 4 Vesta obtained by means of speckle interferometric observations on November 16 and 17, 1983, support a 5-hr 20.5-min rotational period. The 4 Vesta visible light curve was approximately matched by the placing of circular 'spots' with 135-km diameter over the three dark and three bright features, followed by the assigning of albedos of 0 to the dark spots and 2 to the bright. The light curve is found to be primarily defined by albedo structure, rather than shape; this results in one maximum and one minimum/rotation, rather than the two of each that would be associated with 4 Vesta's triaxial ellipsoid morphology.",2013-08-13,1988-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The calculations were done in the fixed-nuclei frozen core approximation. The resulting photoionization spectra, convoluted with a Lorentzian detection function, agree qualitatively with experimental results of Viswanathan et al. (1986) and support their conclusion that the nonspherical nature of the molecular potential creates a substantial l-mixing in the continuum, which in turn leads to the intense Delta N = 0 peak.

The individual canyons were then compared with individual rifts of East Africa. When measured in units of planetary radius, Martian canyons show a distribution of lengths nearly identical to those in Africa, both for individual rifts and for compound rift systems. A common mechanism which scales with planetary radius is suggested. Martian canyons are significantly wider than African rifts. The overall pattern of the rift systems of Africa and Mars are quite different in that the African systems are composed of numerous small faults with highly variable trend. On Mars the trends are less variable; individual scarps are straighter for longer than on earth. This is probably due to the difference in tectonic histories of the two planets: the complex history of the earth and the resulting complicated basement structures influence the development of new rifts. The basement and lithosphere of Mars are inferred to be simple, reflecting a relatively inactive tectonic history prior to the formation of the canyonlands.",2013-09-03,1978-05-01,/api/citations/19780016081/downloads/19780016081.pdf,/api/citations/19780016081/downloads/19780016081.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

These changes are shown to be correlated with the changes in luminosity of micron Ceti in such a way that dust grain emission at 11 microns was increased more than the continuum during the period of maximum luminosity.

A detailed optical design of an f/5 Ebert-Fastie spectrometer was carried out to verify that image quality is adequate; field lenses near the spectrometer focal plane were designed to image the grating onto the smallest size detectors for each channel.",2013-09-03,1977-11-10,/api/citations/19780016809/downloads/19780016809.pdf,/api/citations/19780016809/downloads/19780016809.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Estimates of the north-south and east-west components of the deflections of the vertical as well as values of the geoidal heights were made.

19780016865,COMPUTER OPERATIONS AND HARDWARE,Numerical calculation of transonic flow past a swept wing by a finite volume method,"The utility of numerical methods for predicting transonic flows over wings and bodies is well established. The computer program FLO22, based on a method presented earlier, has actually been widely used to calculate the aerodynamic performance of wings of transport aircraft. Provided that a correction is made for the displacement effect of the viscous boundary layer, this code has been found to give predictions which are accurate enough to serve as a useful design guide. The main disadvantages of the scheme used in FLO22 are the use of nonconservative difference formulas, which result in a failure to satisfy conservation of mass across shock waves, and the difficulty of finding suitable transformations of coordinates to permit the treatment of more complex geometric configurations. The method described here is an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, while retaining the successful features of the previous method. The basic idea is to use a discrete approximation which directly represents a balance of the mass flow through small volume elements. This leads to a relatively simple treatment of the potential flow equation in conservation form.",2013-09-03,1977-12-01,/api/citations/19780016865/downloads/19780016865.pdf,/api/citations/19780016865/downloads/19780016865.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19780016917,NUMERICAL ANALYSIS,Lagrangian computation of inviscid compressible flows,A Lagrangian method is developed to solve the Euler equations of gas dynamics. The solution of the equations is obtained by a numerical computation with the well-known Flux-Corrected-Transport (FCT) numerical method. This procedure is modified so that the boundary treatment is accurate and relatively simple. Shock waves and other flow discontinuities are captured monotonically without any type of fitting procedures. The Lagrangian method is employed so that the problem of mesh generation is completely avoided. The method is applicable to all Mach numbers except the low subsonic range where compressibility effects are small. The method is applied to a one-dimensional Riemann problem (shock tube) and to a two-dimensional supersonic channel flow with reflecting shock waves.,2013-09-03,1978-05-01,/api/citations/19780016917/downloads/19780016917.pdf,/api/citations/19780016917/downloads/19780016917.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Base pressure coefficients were obtained for three step heights. The surface static pressures ahead of and behind the step were measured for the no-step condition and for each of the step heights. A boundary layer rake was used to determine the local boundary layer conditions. The Reynolds number based on the length of flow ahead of the step was approximately 10 to the 8th power and the ratios of momentum thickness to step height ranged from 0.2 to 1.0. Base pressure coefficients were compared with other available data at similar Mach numbers and at ratios of momentum thickness to step height near 1.0.

The hydrogen space velocity could be related to the reactor temperature by the equation Sv = A exp (-omega T), where A and omega are constants determined for each value of alpha and T is temperature. At a methanol conversion of 0.87 and a reactor temperature of 589 K, the extrapolated value of the hydrogen space velocity was 9400 per hour. This velocity was used to estimate the size of an onboard hydrogen reactor for automotive applications. Such a reactor would need only about 0.8 liter of catalyst to produce 7630 STP liters (1.5 lb) of hydrogen per hour.

In heavy structures, the forces involved in the welding process become very large and difficult to handle. With the shuttle's solid rocket booster, the weld peaking resulted in two major problems: (1) reduced mechanical properties across the weld joint, and (2) fit-up difficulties in subsequent assembly operation. Peaking from the weld shrinkage forces can be fairly well predicted in simple structures; however, in welding complicated assemblies, the amount of peaking is unpredictable because of unknown stresses from machining and forming, stresses induced by the fixturing, and stresses from welds in other parts of the assembly. When excessive peaking is encountered, it can be corrected using the shrinkage forces resulting from the welding process.

The navigation position estimate error term and the autopilot flight technical error term are combined to form the total navigation error in each axis. This method of error presentation allows comparisons to be made between other 2-, 3-, or 4-D navigation systems and allows experimental or theoretical determination of the navigation error terms.

Calculations are carried out on a two-dimensional blade-to-blade region of constant radius assumed to occupy a mid-span location. Hub and tip effects are neglected. The Euler equations are solved by MacCormack's method, a viscous marching procedure is used in the boundary layers and wake, and an iterative interaction scheme is constructed that matches them in a way that incorporates information related to momentum and enthalpy thicknesses as well as the displacement thickness.

In the first approach the flow is assumed to be conical and the governing equations are solved at a given Reynolds number with a time-marching explicit finite-difference algorithm. In the second method the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a space-marching implicit noniterative finite-difference algorithm.

19780018203,AIRCRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Low cost fabrication development for oxide dispersion strengthened alloy vanes,"Viable processes were developed for secondary working of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloys to near-net shapes (NNS) for aircraft turbine vanes. These processes were shown capable of producing required microstructure and properties for vane applications. Material cost savings of 40 to 50% are projected for the NNS process over the current procedures which involve machining from rectangular bar. Additional machining cost savings are projected. Of three secondary working processes evaluated, directional forging and plate bending were determined to be viable NNS processes for ODS vanes. Directional forging was deemed most applicable to high pressure turbine (HPT) vanes with their large thickness variations while plate bending was determined to be most cost effective for low pressure turbine (LPT) vanes because of their limited thickness variations. Since the F101 LPT vane was selected for study in this program, development of plate bending was carried through to establishment of a preliminary process. Preparation of ODS alloy plate for bending was found to be a straight forward process using currently available bar stock, providing that the capability for reheating between roll passes is available. Advanced ODS-NiCrAl and ODS-FeCrAl alloys were utilized on this program. Workability of all alloys was adequate for directional forging and plate bending, but only the ODS-FeCrAl had adequate workability for shaped preform extrustion.",2013-09-03,1978-06-01,/api/citations/19780018203/downloads/19780018203.pdf,/api/citations/19780018203/downloads/19780018203.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The airplane is an extensively modified de Havilland Buffalo military transport. The modified airplane has two fan-jet engines which provide vectorable thrust and compressed air for the augmentor jet flap and Boundary-Layer Control (BLC). The augmentor and BLC air is cross ducted to minimize asymmetric moments produced when one engine is inoperative. The modifications incorporated in the airplane include a Stability Augmentation System (SAS), a powered elevator, and a powered lateral control system. The test gross weight of the airplane was between 165,000 and 209,000 N (37,000 and 47,000 lb). Stability, control, and handling qualities are presented for the airspeed range of 40 to 180 knots. The lateral-directional handling qualities are considered satisfactory for the normal operating range of 65 to 160 knots airspeed when the SAS is functioning. With the SAS inoperative, poor turn coordination and spiral instability are primary deficiencies contributing to marginal handling qualities in the landing approach.

The first method involves contouring the test section walls to match approximate streamlines in the flow. Contours are matched to each airfoil tested to produce results close to those obtained in a conventional wind tunnel. Data from a previous study and the present study for two different airfoils demonstrate that useful results are obtained in a shock tube using a test section with contoured walls.

19780018933,ACOUSTICS,Concorde noise-induced building vibrations:  John F. Kennedy International Airport,"Outdoor and indoor noise levels resulting from aircraft flyovers and certain nonaircraft events were recorded at eight homesites and a school along with the associated vibration levels in the walls, windows, and floors at these test sites. Limited subjective tests were conducted to examine the human detection and annoyance thresholds for building vibration and rattle caused by aircraft noise. Both vibration and rattle were detected subjectively in several houses for some operations of both the Concorde and subsonic aircraft. Seated subjects more readily detected floor vibrations than wall or window vibrations. Aircraft noise generally caused more window vibrations than common nonaircraft events such as walking and closing doors. Nonaircraft events and aircraft flyovers resulted in comparable wall vibration levels, while floor vibrations were generally greater for nonaircraft events than for aircraft flyovers. The relationship between structural vibration and aircraft noise is linear, with vibration levels being accurately predicted from overall sound pressure levels (OASPL) measured near the structure. Relatively high levels of structural vibration measured during Concorde operations are due more to higher OASPL levels than to unique Concorde-source characteristics.",2013-09-03,1978-04-01,/api/citations/19780018933/downloads/19780018933.pdf,/api/citations/19780018933/downloads/19780018933.txt,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Two puzzling properties - namely, (1) the broad, rather flat spectrum (over a large range of radio frequencies) and (2) the relatively slow decay of burst amplitude (with decreasing radio frequency) - are explained. Acceptable models are characterized by the following: (1) a nearly conical, adiabatic jet, with conserved magnetic flux transverse to the axis of the jet; (2) prolonged injection (for which the duration of an event exceeds the apparent transit time scale); and (3) a transparent spectral index which is not too steep. It is suggested that the acceleration mechanism in the core of compact jets may differ substantially from that far from the core, producing a flatter electron number index s = 1.4-2.6.",2013-08-13,1988-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Results are presented for the time-averaged emergent energy spectra and the mean residence time in the cloud as a function of energy. Moreover, after Fourier transforming the scattering Green's function, it is shown how the cloud affects both the observed power spectrum of a time-dependent source and the cross spectrum (Fourier transform of a cross correlation between energy bands). It is found that the power spectra intrinsic to the source are related to those observed by a relatively simple frequency-dependent multiplicative factor (a transmission function). The cloud can severely attenuate high frequencies in the power spectra, depending on optical depth, and, at lower frequencies, the transmission function has roughly a Lorentzian shape. It is also found that if the intrinsic energy spectrum is constant in time, the phase of the cross spectrum is determined entirely by scattering. Finally, the implications of the results for studies of the X-ray quasi-periodic oscillators are discussed.",2013-08-13,1988-04-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Flow surveys of pressure and flow angle were taken for both the corners and the vanes to determine their respective losses.

Of 56 dome craters identified on Ganymede, all but two can be placed into one of two classes, based on the ratio of dome diameter to crater rim diameter. Two new hypotheses for the origin of the domes involving diapirism as an agent of dome formation are offered. Implicit in both hypotheses are possible regional heat flux variations. Under these scenarios, 'relaxation' of crater relief may not be homogeneous in space and/or time, and crater morphology may not be a consistent indicator of crater age.

The Pioneer 11 data cover the time period April 1973 through 1986 and the heliocentric radial distance range r of between 1.0 and 2.4 AU. IMP 8, in an approximately circular geocentric orbit of semimajor axis 35 earth radii, provides comparable data at 1 AU over the time period 1974-1986. The combination of the two bodies of data shows that the annual mean intensity of such protons varies as the inverse square of the distance from the sun, irrespective of solar activity as measured by the annual mean sunspot number S. Also it is found that the annual intensity at 1 AU is approximately proportional to S, except for anomalously low values in 1979 and 1980, and that the product of the annual mean intensity at Pioneer 11 by r-squared is also approximately proportional to S, except for anomalously low values in 1979, 1980 (in particular), and 1981.

Metallurgical and fractographic analysis showed that the actual detect was 1.7 in. deep, and originated from an area of lack of weld penetration. Crack growth studies were performed on the shell material in the laboratory under various loading rates, hold times, and R-ratios with a simulated shell environment. The combination of zinc, water with electrolyte, and steel formed an electrolytic cell which resulted in an increase in cyclic crack growth rate by as much as 500 times over that observed in air. It was concluded that slow crack growth occurred in the pressure shell by a combination of stress corrosion cracking due to the welding residual stress and corrosion fatigue due to the cyclic operating stress.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The specific goals were to: (1) relate the mineral content to the spectral reflectance of certain geologic materials, (2) determine the influence of environmental factors, such as atmosphere and vegetation, and (3) improve image processing techniques. For detection of spectral differences related to mineralogy, the technique of band ratioing was found to be the most useful. The influence of atmospheric scattering and methods to correct for the scattering were also studied. Two techniques were used to correct for atmospheric effects: (1) dark object subtraction, (2) normalization of use of ground spectral measurements. Of the two, the first technique proved to be the most successful for removing the effects of atmospheric scattering. A digital mosaic was produced from two side-lapping LANDSAT frames.

19780021333,ENGINEERING (GENERAL),High resolution masks for ion milling pores through substrates of biological interest,"The feasibility was investigated of electrochemically oxidizing vapor deposited aluminum coatings to produce porous aluminum oxide coatings with submicron pore diameters and with straight channels normal to the substrate surface. Porous aluminum oxide coatings were produced from vapor deposited aluminum coatings on thin stainless steel (304), copper, Teflon (FEP) and Kapton substrates and also on pure aluminum substrates. Scanning electron microscope examination indicated that porous oxide coatings can be produced with straight channels, appropriate pore diameters and none or minimal intervening residual aluminum. The oxide coatings on the copper and Kapton substrates had the straightest channels and in general were superior to those fabricated on the other substrate materials. For oxide coatings fabricated at 600 V and 300 V, pore diameters were 0.4-0.6, and 0.3 micron with center-to-center spacing of 0.7-0.8, and 0.4 micron, respectively.

For the case of satellite motion, by a proper transformation and by the method of averaging, a technique appropriate for long duration flight, the classical nonlinear differential equation describing the contraction of the major axis is derived. A rigorous analytic solution is used to integrate this equation with a high degree of accuracy, using Poincare's method of small parameters and Lagrange's expansion to explicitly express the major axis as a function of the eccentricity. The solution is uniformly valid for moderate and small eccentricities. For highly eccentric orbits, the asymptotic equation is derived directly from the general equation.

19880045766,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,Use of curvilinear fiber format to increase structural efficiency,"To increase the effectiveness and efficiency of fiber-reinforced materials, the use of fibers in a curvilinear rather than the traditional straightline format is explored. The capacity of a laminated square plate with a central circular hole loaded in tension is investigated. The orientation of the fibers is chosen so that the fibers in a particular layer are aligned with the principle stress directions in that layer. Finite elements and an iteration scheme are used to find the fiber orientation. A noninteracting maximum strain criterion is used to predict load capacity. The load capacities of several plates with different curvilinear fibers format are compared with the capacities of more conventional straightline format designs. It is found that the most practical curvilinear design sandwiches a group of fibers in a curvilinear format between a pair of +/-45 degree layers. This design has a 60 percent greater load capacity than a conventional quasi-isotropic design with the same number of layers. The +/-45 degree layers are necessary to prevent matrix cracking in the curvilinear layers due to stresses perpendicular to the fibers in those layers. Greater efficiencies are achievable with composite structures than now realized.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

Assuming that the energy is deposited into a thin layer, it is shown that the jump conditions across the layer imply that the fluid jumps to a Mach number of one just downstream of the deposition layer if the deposited energy per unit area exceeds some critical amount. This result is used to estimate the incident flux needed to excite wind from a stellar surface in terms of the star's mass and the penetration grammage of the incident flux.

The desired trajectory is applied as an input to the feedforward controller which behaves as the inverse of the manipulator at any operating point; the controller output is used as the driving torque for the manipulator. The controller gains are then updated by an adaptation algorithm derived from MRAC (model reference adaptive control) theory to cope with variations in the manipulator inverse due to changes of the operating point. An adaptive feedback controller and an auxiliary signal are also used to enhance closed-loop stability and to achieve faster adaptation.

19780023933,ACOUSTICS,Experimental investigation of outdoor propagation of finite-amplitude noise,"The outdoor propagation of finite amplitude acoustic waves was investigated using a conventional electroacoustic transmitter which was mounted on the ground and pointed upward in order to avoid ground reflection effects. The propagation path was parallel to a radio tower 85 m tall, whose elevator carried the receiving microphone. The observations and conclusions are as follows: (1) At the higher source levels nonlinear propagation distortion caused a strong generation of high frequency noise over the propagation path. For example, at 70 m for a frequency 2-3 octaves above the source noise band, the measured noise was up to 30 dB higher than the linear theory prediction. (2) The generation occurred in both the nearfield and the farfield of the transmitter. (3) At no measurement point was small-signal behavior established for the high requency noise. Calculations support the contention that the nonlinearity generated high frequency noise never becomes small-signal in its behavior, regardless of distance. (4) When measured spectra are scaled in frequency and level to make them comparable with spectra of actual jet noise, they are found to be well within the jet noise range.

19780024046,SPACE RADIATION,Gamma ray lines from novae,"Activities identify the mechanisms responsible for the eruptions characterizing cataclysmic variables are concerned with close binary systems, the properties of which are dominated by the presence of mass transfer from a late-type star onto a white dwarf via an accretion disk. Theories for the outbursts vary in their identification of the eruption mechanism with either gravitational or nuclear energy sources. Existing models for the dwarf novae invoke a dynamical instability in the envelope of the red star which triggers episodic Roche lobe overflow and a concomitant increase in the rate of mass transfer and the outbursts are associated with an increase in the accretion luminosity liberated in the disk. The most successful theoretical models for common nova events involve thermonuclear runaways proceeding in accreted hydrogen envelopes on the white dwarf components of these systems. The characteristics of such runaway events, which can give rise to detectable gamma ray fluxes are discussed. Salient features of existing runaway models are reviewed. Gamma fluxes from Na-22 decay, positron annihilation, and shock induction are predicted.",2013-08-09,1978-08-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780024028

In this interpretation, the line radiation results from transitions between transverse energy levels, which are quantized by the field. The expected line luminosity from the excitation of these levels by protons which are falling into the polar cap of a neutron star are calculated. They are assumed to attain kinetic energies up to around 200 MeV, the gravitational potential energy at the surface. The cross sections for high energy Coulomb encounters between small pitch angle protons and electrons in a strong field are measured and used to calculate the energy loss rate of the infalling protons. This rate, together with the rate of elastic nuclear proton collisions, is then used to calculate the number of line photons an infalling proton can be expected to produce, directly or indirectly.

The turbulence input was assumed to have a Dryden power spectral density. The computations were made for lift, rolling moment, and bending moment for two span load distributions, rectangular and elliptic. Data are presented to show the wing-span averaging effect for wing-span ratios encompassing current airplane sizes. The rectangular wing-span loading showed a slightly greater averaging effect than did the elliptic loading. In the frequency range most bothersome to airplane passengers, the wing-span averaging effect can reduce the normal lift load, and thus the acceleration, by about 7 percent for a typical medium-sized transport. Some calculations were made to evaluate the effect of using a Von Karman turbulence representation.

The models have a number of features in common: dynamic mixing must be exceedingly rapid at heights above 90 km; if heterogeneous processes are not assumed to play a major role in the removal of atmospheric CO and O2, mixing must be rapid at heights between 30 and 40 km. The value implied for the diffusion coefficient in this region depends on the assumptions made regarding the rates for reaction of OH with HO2 to form H2O and the rate of reaction of HO2 with itself to form H2O2. If these reaction rates are taken to have values similar to those used in current models of the earth's stratosphere, the eddy diffusion coefficient at 40 km above the Martian surface should be about 5 by 10 to the seventh power sq cm/sec.",2013-08-09,1977-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

The first interpretation is that the spectrum results from optically-thin synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons with a particular energy distribution. The second posits a single nonuniform, self-absorbed source generated by a wind flowing from a central object. The third suggests that sources with flat spectra are caused by the presence of multiple (three or more) discrete uniform components, and that the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution for each source is correlated with the size of the individual components. It is proposed that the last model is the most tenable explanation of the phenomenon, and multi-frequency VLBI observations are suggested for the evaluation of the detailed structure of compact radio sources.",2013-08-09,1977-10-01,,,CDMS,OTHER,

A significant fraction, about 20-60%, of the energy of the bursts falls in the hard X-ray range (20-130 keV). The time-integrated spectra have been fitted by power-law, exponential, and thermal-bremsstrahlung functions. They are consistent with power laws which steepen at energies of at least 150 keV, as reported earlier for two other bursts. Evidence for spectral variability from event to event in the hard X-ray region is presented. For a power-law representation, the power-law index has values ranging from approximately unity to 2.5.

With the probe's orbit passing over the pole, the structure of the polar field can be directly measured. The detector plane of the system receives a telecentric image of the objective.

The suprathermal energy range, which extends from solar wind energies (approximately 1 KeV) to about 1 MeV/nucleon, is of special interest to studies of nonthermal acceleration processes because a large fraction of particles is likely to be accelerated into this energy range. Data obtained from near earth observations of particles in the suprathermal energy range are reviewed.

Adaptable instruments are required to cover the large dynamic range of parameters between 1 AU and 4 solar radii. The baseline mission would be improved, in some respects, by the addition of a second spacecraft, following the first by a distance of several solar radii. A spinning spacecraft would be satisfactory, but not essential, for the present objectives. Attention should be paid to having the heat shield electrically conducting. An instrument for ion and electron (but no composition) measurements would have a mass of approximately 10 kg, require 8 w of power, and generate data at a maximum rate of approximately 2 kbits/sec.",2013-08-09,1978-09-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780025021

The shape of the electron density irregularity spectrum is shown to be well modeled by a power law in wavenumber with a slope that abruptly steepens at higher wavenumbers. This two slope power law model is shown to have a break (defined as the wavenumber of the change of slope) that increases with decreasing distance from the Sun. The fractional random velocity is shown to be insignificant at distances of greater than 40 solar radii, but shows a steady increase with decreasing solar distance inside of 40 solar radii.",2013-08-09,1978-09-01,,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780025021
