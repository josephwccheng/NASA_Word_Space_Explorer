The physical principle is the same as that resulting in the phase changes measured in the Fizeau experiment. It is proposed that this phase change could be measured using a three cornered arrangement of satellite borne source and reflectors, around which two laser beams propagate in opposite directions. It is shown that even though the velocity of the satellites is much larger than the wind velocity, factors such as change in satellite position and Doppler shifts can be taken into account in a reasonable manner and the Fizeau phase measured. This phase measurement yields an average wind velocity along the ray path through the atmosphere. The method requires neither high accuracy for satellite position or velocity, nor precise knowledge of the refractive index or its gradient in the atmosphere. However, the method intrinsically yields wind velocity integrated along the ray path; hence to obtain higher spatial resolution, inversion techniques are required.",2013-09-04,1980-11-01,/api/citations/19810007123/downloads/19810007123.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Satellite-derived and hourly observed surface wind fields are compared. Results indicate that the best satellite-derived wind on constant pressure charts is a geostrophic wind derived from highly smoothed fields of geopotential height. Satellite-derived winds computed in this manner and rawinsonde winds show similar circulation patterns except in areas of small height gradients. Magnitudes of the standard deviation of the differences between satellite derived and rawinsonde wind speeds range from approximately 3 to 12 m/sec on constant pressure charts and peak at the jet stream level. Fields of satellite-derived surface wind computed with the logarithmic wind law agree well with fields of observed surface wind in most regions.

The results indicate that both elevated burning rate induced by the tangential wave motions and variable nozzle blockage due to passage of vortical flow through the nozzle throat must act together to generate the large mean pressure peaks observed in the tests. There is strong correlation between the amplitude of wave motions and the level of mean pressure rise. Evidence for the presence of traveling tangential waves at the time of the D.C. shift was found by use of dual Kistler pressure transducers mounted at the head end of the burner. A very unusual frequency history was found to accompany the high amplitude disturbances. This was consistent from test to test and may represent an additional source of information regarding the complicated flow combustion interactions within the propellant burning zone.",2013-08-11,1980-11-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19810007903,FLUID MECHANICS AND HEAT TRANSFER,Theory of strong turbulence by renormalization,"The hydrodynamical equations of turbulent motions are inhomogeneous and nonlinear in their inertia and force terms and will generate a hierarchy. A kinetic method was developed to transform the hydrodynamic equations into a master equation governing the velocity distribution, as a function of the time, the position and the velocity as an independent variable. The master equation presents the advantage of being homogeneous and having fewer nonlinear terms and is therefore simpler for the investigation of closure. After the closure by means of a cascade scaling procedure, the kinetic equation is derived and possesses a memory which represents the nonMarkovian character of turbulence. The kinetic equation is transformed back to the hydrodynamical form to yield an energy balance in the cascade form. Normal and anomalous transports are analyzed. The theory is described for incompressible, compressible and plasma turbulence. Applications of the method to problems relating to sound generation and the propagation of light in a nonfrozen turbulence are considered.",2013-09-04,1981-01-22,/api/citations/19810007903/downloads/19810007903.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The loads, accelerations, thermal environments, temperatures and distortions were calculated for a variety of operational SPS conditions along with statistical considerations of material properties, manufacturing tolerances, measurement accuracy and the resulting loss of sight (LOS) and local slope distributions. A LOS error and a subarray rms slope error of two arc minutes can be achieved with a passive system. Results show that existing materials measurement, manufacturing, assembly and alignment techniques can be used to build the microwave power transmission system antenna structure. Manufacturing tolerance can be critical to rms slope error. The slope error budget can be met with a passive system. Structural joints without free play are essential in the assembly of the large truss structure.

A photoconductive sensor with a reflective collecting surface determines the displacement and polarity of any misalignment and automatically engages a stepping motor to drive a variable-length mechanism to make the necessary corrections. Once aligned, little power is dissipated since a nulling bridge circuit that centers on the beam is used. A three-point subarray alignment arrangement is described which independently adjusts, in the three orthogonal directions, the height and tilt of subarrays within the MPTS array and readily adapts to any physical distortions of the secondary structure (such as that resulting from severe temperature extremes caused by an eclipse of the Sun). It is shown that only one rotating laser system is required since optical blockage is minimal on the array surface and that it is possible to incorporate a number of redundant laser systems for reliability without affecting the overall performance.",2013-08-11,1980-12-01,/api/citations/19810008022/downloads/19810008022.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19810008016

Potted valencia orange and dwarf citrus trees, four species of plants native to Merritt Island, and four agronomic species were exposed to various pH levels of simulated acid rain under controlled conditions. The acid rain was generated from dilutions of hydrochloric acid solutions or by passing water through an exhaust generated by burning solid rocket fuel. The plants were injured severely at pH levels below 1.0, but showed only slight injury at pH levels of 2.0 and above. Threshold injury levels were between 2.0 and 3.0 pH. The sensitivity of the different plant species to acid solutions was similar. Foliar injury symptoms were representative of acid rain including necrosis of young tissue, isolated necrotic spots or patches, and leaf abscission.

A macroscopic model was devised to deal with the simultaneous effects of diffusion and coagulation of particles in the confined aerosol. An analytical solution was found by treating the particle coagulation and diffusion constants as ensemble parameters and employing a transformation of variables. The solution was used to carry out simulated zero gravity aerosol decay experiments in a compact cylindrical chamber. The results demonstrate that the limitations of physical space and time imposed by the orbital situation are not prohibitive in terms of observing the history of an aerosol confined under zero gravity conditions. While the absence of convective effects would be a definite benefit for the experiment, the mathematical complexity of the problem is not greatly reduced when the gravitational term drops out of the equation. Since the model does not deal directly with the evolution of the particle size distribution, it may be desirable to develop more detailed models before undertaking an orbital experiment.",2013-09-04,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810008164/downloads/19810008164.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810011151,GEOPHYSICS,A stochastic-dynamic model for global atmospheric mass field statistics,A model that yields the spatial correlation structure of atmospheric mass field forecast errors was developed. The model is governed by the potential vorticity equation forced by random noise. Expansion in spherical harmonics and correlation function was computed analytically using the expansion coefficients. The finite difference equivalent was solved using a fast Poisson solver and the correlation function was computed using stratified sampling of the individual realization of F(omega) and hence of phi(omega). A higher order equation for gamma was derived and solved directly in finite differences by two successive applications of the fast Poisson solver. The methods were compared for accuracy and efficiency and the third method was chosen as clearly superior. The results agree well with the latitude dependence of observed atmospheric correlation data. The value of the parameter c sub o which gives the best fit to the data is close to the value expected from dynamical considerations.,2013-09-04,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810011151/downloads/19810011151.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Similarly, procedures used to process the data are characterized by frequent changes early in the life of a satellite series as user experience is gained with the new instrument. Later the changes become less frequent, both because the processing system becomes well tuned to that particular set of instruments and because, at the end of a series, resources are devoted to generating the processing system for the next set of instruments. Past and present systems are considered with emphasis on the vertical temperature profile radiometer and a procedure for deriving clear radiances in partly cloudy areas.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19810011182

It was also shown that background radiation is effectively suppressed by the optical homodyne receiver: Significant deterioration in receiver performance is observed only in the presence of extremely intense background fields.

Three of the horizontal tails were low tail configurations and two were T tail configurations. All tails were tested in conjunction with two wings, a current wide body wing and a high aspect ratio supercritical wing. Local downwash angles and dynamic pressures in the vicinity of the tails were measured using a yaw head rake. The results provide a comparison of the aerodynamic characteristics of the two wing configurations at trimmed conditions for Mach numbers between 0.60 and 0.90.

The multicolored SOR method uses a generalization of the classical Red/Black grid point ordering for the SOR method. These multicolored orderings have the advantage of allowing the SOR method to be implemented as a Jacobi method, which is ideal for arrays of processors, but still enjoy the greater rate of convergence of the SOR method. The program solves a general second order self adjoint elliptic problem on a square region with Dirichlet boundary conditions, discretized by quadratic elements on triangular regions. For this general problem and discretization, six colors are necessary for the multicolored method to operate efficiently. The specific problem that was solved using the six color program was Poisson's equation; for Poisson's equation, three colors are necessary but six may be used. In general, the number of colors needed is a function of the differential equation, the region and boundary conditions, and the particular finite element used for the discretization.",2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19810011267/downloads/19810011267.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810011471,SPACE RADIATION,Galactic X-ray emission from pulsars,"The contribution of pulsars to the gamma-ray flux from the galactic plane is examined using data from the most recent pulsar surveys. It is assumed that pulsar gamma-rays are produced by curvature radiation from relativistic particles above the polar cap and attenuated by pair production in the strong magnetic and electric fields. Assuming that all pulsars produce gamma-rays in this way, their luminosities can be predicted as a function of period and magnetic field strength. Using the distribution of pulsars in the galaxy as determined from data on 328 pulsars detected in three surveys, the local gamma-ray production spectrum, the longitude profile, and the latitude profile of pulsar gamma-ray flux are calculated. The largest sources of uncertainty in the size of the pulsar contribution are the value of the mean interstellar electron density, the turnover in the pulsar radio luminosity function, and the average pulsar magnetic field strength. A present estimate is that pulsars contribute from 15 to 20 % of the total flux of gamma-rays from the galactic plane.",2013-09-04,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810011471/downloads/19810011471.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810012467,ASTROPHYSICS,On the complex state of the interplanetary medium of 28-29 July 1977,Observations of plasma and magnetic field variations in the near-Earth solar wind are discussed. Both a corotating stream and a driven shock are present. The driver gas seems to be enveloped in the rising speed phase of this stream; this appearance is attributed to a convoluted surface separating the two plasma domains. The magnetic field in the post shock flow (0030-1230 UT of July 29) has a large and geoeffective southward component at times; the energy coupling coefficient reaches approximately 5.4 x 10 to the 19th power ergs/s. In the driver gas (1230 UT of July 29 to 0110 of July 30) the magnetic field is dominantly northward. The density and dynamic pressure decrease by almost two orders of magnitude (100 to  2 cm/3) from just behind the interplanetary shock to approximately 3 hours into the driver gas flow. The dominant magnetic field variation in the driver gas is modeled by a cloud-like structure. Significant plasma parameter variations within the driver gas are attributed to structure in the parent solar mass ejection event and to interplanetary kinematics.,2013-09-04,1981-02-01,/api/citations/19810012467/downloads/19810012467.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The procedure that was developed and evaluated was found to be capable of determining highly accurate approximations to families of strongly nonlinear solutions which are either continuous or discontinuous, and which represent variations in some arbitrary parameter. Coordinate straining is employed to account for the movement of discontinuities and maxima of high gradient regions due to the perturbation. The development and results reported are for the single parameter perturbation problem. Flows past both isolated airfoils and compressor cascades involving a wide variety of flow and geometry parameter changes are reported. Attention is focused in particular on transonic flows which are strongly supercritical and exhibit large surface shock movement over the parametric range studied; and on subsonic flows which display large pressure variations in the stagnation and peak suction pressure regions. Comparisons with the corresponding 'exact' nonlinear solutions indicate a remarkable accuracy and range of validity of such a procedure.",2013-09-04,1981-05-01,/api/citations/19810013482/downloads/19810013482.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In the zero-gravity drop tower tests, a blue flame surrounded the rod, showing that a gas phase reaction in which carbon monoxide was oxidized to carbon dioxide was taking place. The ratio of flame diameter to rod diameter was obtained as a function of time. It was found that this ratio was inversely proportional to both the oxygen pressure and the rod diameter. In the normal gravity tests, direct mass spectrometric sampling was used to measure gas phase concentrations. The gas sampling probe was positioned near the circumference of a horizontally mounted 0.615 cm diameter carbon rod, either at the top or at angles of 45 deg to 90 deg from the top, and yielded concentration profiles of CO2, CO, and O2 as a function of distance from the surface. The mechanism controlling the combustion process was found to change from chemical process control at the 90 deg and 45 deg probe positions to mass transfer control at the 0 deg probe position at the top of the rod. Under the experimental conditions used, carbon combustion was characterized by two surface reactions, 2C + O2 yields 2CO and CO2 + C yields 2CO, and a gas phase reaction, 2CO + O2 yields 2CO2.",2013-09-04,1981-05-01,/api/citations/19810013786/downloads/19810013786.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19810015078,ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONVERSION,Anti-reflection coatings applied by acid leaching process,The Magicote C process developed by S.M. Thompsen was evaluated for use in applying an antireflective coating to the cover plates of solar panels. The process uses a fluosilicic acid solution supersaturated with silica at elevated temperature to selectively attack the surface of soda-lime glass cover plates and alter the physical and chemical composition of a thin layer of glass. The altered glass layer constitutes an antireflective coating. The process produces coatings of excellent optical quality which possess outstanding resistance to soiling and staining. The coatings produced are not resistant to mechanical abrasion and are attacked to some extent by glass cleansers. Control of the filming process was found to be difficult.,2013-09-04,1980-09-01,/api/citations/19810015078/downloads/19810015078.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Large scale phenomena such as the superrotation of Venus and cyclones are effectively bounded by the rigidly rotating planetary surface.

For either case the flow rate data could be represented by a flow coefficient reduced temperature plot. At a separation distance of 30 tube diameters the pressure profiles dropped sharply at the entrance and recovered within each Borda tube; except at low temperatures, where fluid jetting through the last Borda tube occurred.

Fuel nozzles ranged in size from 0.051 to 0.305 cm inside radius, while the coaxial, convergent, air nozzle had a 1.4 cm inside radius at the fuel exit plane. Fuel flows ranged from 1.55 to 10.3 cu cm/sec and air flows from 0 to 597 cu cm/sec. A computer program developed under a previous government contract was used to calculate the characteristic dimensions of normal and zero-gravity flames only. The results include a comparison between the experimental data and the computed axial flame lengths for normal gravity and zero gravity which showed good agreement. Inverted-gravity flame width was correlated with the ratio of fuel nozzle radius to average fuel velocity. Flame extinguishment upon entry into weightlessness was studied, and it was found that relatively low forced-air velocities (approximately 10 cm/sec) are sufficient to sustain methane flame combustion in zero gravity.

Effects of each of these parameters on the measured tire characteristics are discussed and, where possible, compared with previous work.

Both methods use an average sampling interval to compute lagged products. One method, the correlation function power spectrum, takes the discrete Fourier transform of the lagged products directly to obtain the spectrum, while the other, the modified Blackman-Tukey power spectrum, takes the Fourier transform of the mean lagged products. Both techniques require fewer calculations than other procedures since only 50% to 80% of the maximum lags need be calculated. The algorithms are compared with the Fourier transform power spectrum and two least squares procedures (all for an arbitrary data spacing). Examples are given showing recovery of frequency components from simulated periodic data where portions of the time series are missing and random noise has been added to both the time points and to values of the function. In addition the methods are compared using real data.

Asymptotic formulae are developed in the opposite extremes of Lorentz contracted acoustic wavelength large/small compared with the chord of the flap. Interpolation between these limiting results enables the field shape and its dependence on subsonic forward flight speed to be predicted over the whole frequency range. It is shown that the mean width of the side edge gap between the flap and the undeflected portion of the airfoil has a significant influence on the intensity of the radiated sound. It is estimated that the noise generated at a single side edge of a full scale part span flap can exceed that produced along the whole of the trailing edge of the flap by 3 dB or more.,2013-09-04,1981-06-01,/api/citations/19810016318/downloads/19810016318.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Theoretical analysis is presented which shows that such spectral broadening is entirely consistent with amplitude modulation of the acoustic signal by the time-varying shear layer. Thus, no actual frequency shift need be hypothesized to explain the spectral phenomenon. Experimental tests were conducted at 2, 4, and 6 kHz and at free jet flow velocities of 10, 20, and 30 m/s. Analysis of acoustic pressure time histories obtained from these tests confirms the above conclusion, at least for the low Mach numbers considered.",2013-09-04,1981-05-01,/api/citations/19810016319/downloads/19810016319.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The synergistic data are reasonably well estimated or bracketed by the high- and low-angle-of-attack vortex lift theories over the Mach number range and up to maximum lift or strake-vortex breakdown over the wing. Also, the strake geometry is very important in the maximum lift value generated and the lift efficiency of a given additional area. Increasing size and slenderness ratios are important is generating lift efficiently, but similar efficiency can also be achieved by designing a strake with approximately half the area of the largest gothic strake tested.

For a turbine inlet temperature of 15000 K the Brayton powerplant weighted 5 to 40% less than the thermionic concept. The out of core concept separates the thermionic converters from their reactor. Technical risks are diminished by: (1) moving the insolator out of the reactor; (2) allowing a higher thermal flux for the thermionic converters than is required of the reactor fuel; and (3) eliminating fuel swelling's threat against lifetime of the thermionic converters. Overall performance can be improved by including power processing in system optimization for design and technology on more efficient, higher temperature power processors.

19810017369,ASTROPHYSICS,New insight into the physics of atmospheres of early type stars,The phenomenon of mass loss and stellar winds from hot stars are discussed. The mass loss rate of early type stars increases by about a factor of 100 to 1000 during their evolution. This seems incompatible with the radiation driven wind models and may require another explanation for the mass loss from early type stars. The winds of early type stars are strongly variable and the stars may go through active phases. Eclipses in binary systems by the stellar winds can be used to probe the winds. A few future IUE studies are suggested.,2013-08-11,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810017369/downloads/19810017369.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19810017357

Two of the giants, 77 Tau and gamma Tau, clearly exhibit emission in the high temperature ions such as N V, C IV, and Si IV at levels several times larger than the upper limits for the other two giants, delta Tau and epsilon Tau. Comparison of the Mg II h and k fluxes and the Ca II K emission strengths shows that 77 Tau and gamma Tau have larger chromospheric radiative losses than delta Tau, epsilon Tau, and beta Gem, a field giant which also displays low upper limits to emission from high temperature ions. Coronal X-ray emission indicates that the surface flux in X-rays is an order of magnitude brighter in 77 Tau than in delta Tau. The results indicate that a parameter other than age, temperature, gravity or metallicity determines the amount of chromospheric and coronal emission in late-type giants.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,/api/citations/19810017392/downloads/19810017392.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19810017357

The hot companion of Mira (o Cet) is surprisingly faint in the short wavelength region, but it excites a rich emission spectrum from the surrounding gas. The ultraviolet active M7 giant CH Cyg is shown to be a binary with a hot companion.

Analysis of the intense UV continuum observed between 1100 A to 2000 A suggests this star is a binary system in which the secondary is identified as a hot subdwarf with T sub eff being approximately 100,000 K. A distance to the system of 1000 pc is deduced. The UV spectrum consists of mainly semiforbidden and allowed transition lines of which the CIV (1548 A, 1550 A) emission lines are particularly strong, and UV continuum at both shorter and longer wavelengths. Strong forbidden lines seem to be absent suggesting the presence of a nebula of high densities. Tidal interaction between the red giant primary and the hot subdwarf is suggested as a likely means to form the observed nebula. RW Hya is suggested as a possible source of soft X-ray emission from material accreting onto the surface of the hot subdwarf. Detection of such emission with HEAO-B would give information if this accretion is taking place via Roche lobe overlow or via capture from a stellar wind emitted by the primary.

It is called a loop free logic model of the system. On the basis of an intrinsic property of the mathematical structure, a characterization of system component failure in terms of maximal subsets of bad test signals of the system was obtained. Also, as a consequence, information concerning the total number of failure components in the system was deduced.

The method includes the use of a narrow vehicle which moves underground along the mineral seam and which is connected by pipes or hoses to water pumps at the surface of the Earth. The vehicle hydraulically drills pilot holes during its entrances into the seam, and then directs sideward jets at the seam during its withdrawal from each pilot hole to comminute the mineral surrounding the pilot hole and combine it with water into a slurry, so that the slurried mineral can flow to a location where a pump raises the slurry to the surface.",2013-09-04,1980-10-07,/api/citations/19810017972/downloads/19810017972.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The calculation is done as a least mean-squares value fit to a set of spherical harmonics up to any desired order. The program accepts as a set of input the orbit position of a satellite coordinates it with ground-based magnetic data for a given time. The output is a predicted time series for the magnetic field on the Earth's surface at the (r, theta) position directly under the hypothetically orbiting satellite for the duration of the time period of the input data set. By tracking the surface magnetic field beneath the satellite, narrow-band averages crosspowers between the spatially coordinated satellite and the ground-based data sets are computed. These crosspowers are used to calculate field transfer coefficients with minimum noise distortion. The application of this technique to calculating the vector response function W is discussed.",2013-09-04,1981-01-09,/api/citations/19810017982/downloads/19810017982.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The cross spectra of these measurements are used to determine the levels of the far-field noise that propagated from the engine vore. The technique makes it possible to measure core noise levels even when other noise sources dominate. The technique was applied to signals measured from an Avco Lycoming YF102 turbofan engine.

These images were reduced to absolute far-UV intensity distributions over the area of the LMC, with 3 to 5 arc min angular resolution. Comparison of these far-UV measurements in the LMC with H sub alpha and 21 cm surveys reveals that interstellar hydrogen in the LMC is often concentrated in 100 pc clouds within 500 pc clouds. Furthermore, at least 25 associations of O-B stars in the LMC are outside the interstellar hydrogen clouds; four of them appear to be on the far side. Far-UV and mid-UV spectra were obtained of stars in 12 of these associations, using the International Ultraviolet Explorer. Equivalent widths of L alpha and six other lines, and relative intensities of the continuum at seven wavelength from 1300 A to 2900 A, were measured.

The variability by a factor of two in less than a day reported by Snyder, et al (1979) is confirmed. Two spectra, obtained a year apart, while the satellite was in scanning mode, are well fit by simple power laws with energy spectral index alpha sub 1 equals approximately 1.4. A third spectrum, of higher statistical quality, obtained while the satellite was pointed at its source, has has two components. An acceptable fit was obtained using a two power law model, with indices alpha sub 1 equals 2.0 (+1.2, -0.6) and alpha sub 2 equals -1.5 (+1.5, -2.3). An interpretation of the overall spectrum from radio through X-rays in terms of a synchrotron self-Compton model gives a good description of the data if allowance is made for relativistic beaming. Thus, from a consideration of the spectrum, combined with an estimate of the size of the source, the presence of jets is inferred without their observation.",2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19810018460/downloads/19810018460.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The properties of adsorbed carbon, cesium, and cesium-oxygen layers were investigated on LaB6 single crystal surfaces as well as on Zr/0/W(100) and W(100). Cesium was found to increase electron reflection near the collision threshold on LaB6(100) and W(100) and to decrease the reflection on Zr/0/W(100).

This investigation was concerned with tension, compression, and short beam shear coupon testing of large samples from three different material suppliers to determine their statistical strength behavior. Statistical results indicate that a two Parameter Weibull distribution model provides better overall characterization of material behavior for the graphite-epoxy systems tested than does the standard Normal distribution model that is employed for most design work. While either a Weibull or Normal distribution model provides adequate predictions for average strength values, the Weibull model provides better characterization in the lower tail region where the predictions are of maximum design interest.

A high pressure fuel coking test apparatus was designed and developed and was used to evaluate thermal decomposition (coking) limits and carbon deposition rates in heated copper tubes for two hydrocarbon rocket fuels, RP-1 and commercial-grade propane. Tests were also conducted using JP-7 and chemically-pure propane as being representative of more refined cuts of the baseline fuels. A parametric evaluation of fuel thermal stability was performed at pressures of 136 atm to 340 atm, bulk fuel velocities in the range 6 to 30 m/sec, and tube wall temperatures in the range 422 to 811 K. Results indicated that substantial deposit formation occurs with RP-1 fuel at wall temperatures between 600 and 800 K, with peak deposit formation occurring near 700 K. No improvements were obtained when deoxygenated JP-7 fuel was substituted for RP-1. The carbon deposition rates for the propane fuels were generally higher than those obtained for either of the kerosene fuels at any given wall temperature. There appeared to be little difference between commercial-grade and chemically-pure propane with regard to type and quantity of deposit. Results of tests conducted with RP-1 indicated that the rate of deposit formation increased slightly with pressure over the range 136 atm to 340 atm. Finally, lating the inside wall of the tubes with nickel was found to significantly reduce carbon deposition rates for RP-1 fuel.",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19810021741/downloads/19810021741.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Both broad band and narrow band data wre obtained for a range of distances and azimuth angles from the machine. The rotor sound spectra are random in character and peak in the frequency ranges 30 to 50 Hz and 800 to 1300 Hz. Both peaks are predictable from experience with helicopter rotors and propellers. Results suggest that the lower frequency peak is due to the effects of inflow turbulence and the higher frequency peak is due to the interactions of the turbulent boundary layers with the trailing edges of the blades. The boundary layer related sound is the dominant component in the audible frequency range and determines the detectability of the machine. It could be detected at a distance of 1350 m in the upwind direction where the background noise was 30 dB (A) and at distances in excess of 2100 m in the downwind direction.

Two essential components of the Digicon, the semiconductor diode array and the UV transmitting window, generate noise when subjected to medium-energy proton radiation, a primary component of the belt. These trapped protons, having energies ranging from 2 to 400 Mev and fluences at the Digicon up to 4,000 P+/sec-sq cm, pass through both the window and the diode array, depositing energy in each. In order to evaluate the effect of these protons, engineering test models of Digicon tubes to be flown on the High Resolution Spectrograph were irradiated with low-flux monoenergetic proton beams at the University of Maryland cyclotron. Electron-hole pairs produced by the protons passing through the diodes or the surrounding bulk caused a background count rate. This is the result of holes diffusing over a distance of many diode spacings, causing counts to be triggered simultaneously in the output circuits of several adjacent diodes. Pulse-height spectra of these proton-induced counts indicate that most of the bulk-related counts overlap the single photoelectron peak. A geometrical model will be presented of the charge collection characteristics of the diode array that accounts for most of the observed effects.",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19810022738/downloads/19810022738.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19810022745,COMPOSITE MATERIALS,Fillers for improved graphite fiber retention by polymer matrix composites,"The results of a program designed to determine the extent to which elemental boron and boron containing fillers added to the matrix resin of graphite/epoxy composites prevent the release of graphite fibers when the composites are exposed to fire and impact conditions are described. The fillers evaluated were boron, boron carbide and aluminum boride. The conditions evaluated were laboratory simulations of those that could exist in the event of an aircraft crash and burn situation. The baseline (i.e., unfilled) laminates evaluated were prepared from commercially available graphite/epoxy. The baseline and filled laminates' mechanical properties, before and after isothermal and humidity aging, also were compared. It was found that a small amount of graphite fiber was released from the baseline graphite/epoxy laminates during the burn and impact conditions used in this program. However, the extent to which the fibers were released is not considered a severe enough problem to preclude the use of graphite reinforced composites in civil aircraft structure. It also was found that the addition of boron and boron containing fillers to the resin matrix eliminated this fiber release. Mechanical properties of laminates containing the boron and boron containing fillers were lower than those of the baseline laminates. These property degradations for two systems: boron (5 micron) at 2.5 percent filler loading, and boron (5 micron) at 5.0 percent filler loading do not appear severe enough to preclude their use in structural composite applications.",2013-09-04,1981-09-23,/api/citations/19810022745/downloads/19810022745.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19810022822,NONMETALLIC MATERIALS,Development of silane-hydrolysate binder for UV-resistant thermal control coatings,"Detailed characterizaton and formulation studies were performed on a methyltriakoxysilane hydrolysate as a binder for thermal control coatings. The binder was optimized by varying hydrolysis temperature, time, catalyst type, and water concentration. The candidate coating formulations, based on this binder with TiO2 pigment, were optimized via a detailed series of sprayed test panels that included the parameters of binder/pigment ratio, ethanol content, pigment particle size, coating thickness and cure conditions. A typical optimized coating was prepared by acetic acid catalyzed hydrolysis of methyltriethoxysilane with 3.25 mol-equivalents of water over a 24 hour period at room temperature. The resulting hydrolysate was directly mixed with pre-milled TiO2 (12 grams pigment/26 grams binder) to yield a sprayable consistency. Panels were sprayed to result in a nominal cure coating thickness of 2 mils. Cure was affected by air drying for 24 hr at room temperature plus 72 hr at 150 F. These coatings are typically extremely tough and abrasion-resistant, with an absorptance (alpha) of 0.20 and emittance (e) of 0.89. No significant coating damage was observed in the mandrel bend test, even after exposure to thermal cycling from -160 to 160 F. Vacuum exposure of the coatings for 930 hours at 1 equivalent UV sun resulted in no visible degradation and no significant increase in absorptance.",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19810022822/downloads/19810022822.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The SIP material is used on the Space Shuttle to isolate the ceramic insulating tiles from the strains and deflections of the aluminum alloy airframe. In all tests, 12.7 by 12.7 cm (5.0 by 5.0 in) SIP specimens were subjected to tension-tension loading in the through-the-thickness direction at a frequency of 10 Hz. When subjected to cyclic loading, the SIP material exhibited a monotonic increase in thickness and a monotonic increase in tensile tangent moduli. The rate of thickness growth increased with increasing test stress level and decreased with increasing number cycles endured. Power law equations were found to provide a good representation of the thickness growth rate data. Tensile tangent moduli increased by as much as 80 percent during fatigue tests. Simple cumulative damage fatigue models predicted the mean thickness growth under random-amplitude loading with reasonable accuracy (factor of 2 on life).",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19810023034/downloads/19810023034.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Area-time averaged energetics indicate that horizontal flux convergence provides the major energy source to the region, while cross contour flow provides the greatest sink. Maximum energy variability is found in the upper levels in association with jet stream activity. Area averaged energetics at individual observation times show that the energy balance near times of maximum storm activity differs considerably from that of the remaining periods. The local kinetic energy balance over Oklahoma during the formation of a limited jet streak receives special attention. Cross contour production of energy is the dominant local source for jet development.

19810023203,METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,The outlook for precipitation measurements from space,"To provide useful precipitation measurements from space, two requirements must be met: adequate spatial and temporal sampling of the storm and sufficient accuracy in the estimate of precipitation intensity. Although presently no single instrument or method completely satisfies both requirements, the visible/IR, microwave radiometer and radar methods can be used in a complementary manner. Visible/IR instruments provide good temporal sampling and rain area depiction, but recourse must be made to microwave measurements for quantitative rainfall estimates. The inadequacy of microwave radiometer measurements over land suggests, in turn, the use of radar. Several recently developed attenuating-wavelength radar methods are discussed in terms of their accuracy, dynamic range and system implementation. Traditionally, the requirements of high resolution and adequate dynamic range led to fairly costly and complex radar systems. Some simplications and cost reduction can be made; however, by using K-band wavelengths which have the advantages of greater sensitivity at the low rain rates and higher resolution capabilities. Several recently proposed methods of this kind are reviewed in terms of accuracy and system implementation. Finally, an adaptive-pointing multi-sensor instrument is described that would exploit certain advantages of the IR, radiometric and radar methods.",2013-09-04,1981-07-01,/api/citations/19810023203/downloads/19810023203.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Recent observations from Nimbus-7 show the solar flux is varying by significant amounts also in the regions from 200 nm up to the Calcium 2 H-line at 396.8 nm.

During operation, the small platinum crystallites sinter, causing loss in cell performance. A support was developed that stabilizes platinum in the high surface area condition by retarding or preventing the sintering process. The approach is to form etch pits in the carbon by oxidizing the carbon in the presence of a metal oxide catalyst, remove the metal oxide by an acid wash, and then deposit platinum in these pits. Results confirm the formation of etch pits in each of the three supports chosen for investigation: Vulcan XC-72R, Vulcan XC-72 that was graphized at 2500 C, and Shawinigan Acetylene Black.",2013-09-04,1981-04-01,/api/citations/19810013942/downloads/19810013942.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In tropical regions, the west winds and ozone maxima are in phase while at higher latitudes, a more nearly out-of-phase relationship prevails.

Study results include identification of possible health or safety effects on space workers either immediate or delayed due to the zero gravity environment and acceleration and deceleration; estimation of the probability that an individual will be adversely affected; description of the possible consequence to work efficiency in persons adversely affected; and description of the possible/probable consequences to immediate and future health of individuals exposed to this environment. A research plan, which addresses the uncertainties in current knowledge regarding the health and safety hazards to exposed SPS space workers, is presented. Although most adverse affects experienced during space flight soon disappeared upon return to the Earth's environment, there remains a definite concern for the long-term effects to SPS space workers who might spend as much as half their time in space during a possible five year career period. The proposed 90 day up/90 day down cycle, coupled with the fact that most of the effects of weightlessness may persist throughout the flight along with the realization that recovery may occupy much of the terrestrial stay, may keep the SPS workers in a deviant physical condition or state of flux for 60 to 100% of their five year career.",2013-09-04,1980-11-01,/api/citations/19810014160/downloads/19810014160.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Titanium, which produces two deep levels in silicon, degrades cell performance by reducing bulk lifetime and thus cell short-circuit current. Electrically active grain boundaries induce carrier recombination in the bulk and depletion regions of the solar cell. Experimental data imply a small but measurable segregation of titanium into some grain boundaries of the polycrystalline silicon containing high Ti concentration. However, for the titanium-contaminated polycrystalline material used in this study, solar cell performance is dominated by the electrically active titanium concentration in the grains.

19810036831,ASTROPHYSICS,Stellar coronae from Einstein - Observations and theory,"Einstein Observatory observations of stellar X-ray emission are presented and their implications for the formation of stellar coronae and the problem of stellar angular momentum loss are discussed. Solar coronal X-ray observations and observations of stellar coronae made prior to Einstein are reviewed, and it is noted that they already suggest that the standard theory of acoustic coronal heating is inadequate. The principal results of the Einstein/CfA stellar survey are summarized, with attention given to variations of the level of X-ray flux detected along the main sequence, the decline of X-ray flux with increasing age of giants and supergiants, and indications of a large range of X-ray emission levels within a given type, which are clearly incompatible with models for acoustic flux generation. A new theory to explain stellar coronae and hence X-ray emission from them is then proposed in which stellar magnetic fields play the key role in determining the level of coronal emission, and the modulation of the surface magnetic flux level and the level of stressing of surface magnetic fields essentially determine the variation of mean coronal activity in the H-R diagram.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810036833,ASTROPHYSICS,The X-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies,"Spectral observations of clusters of galaxies are presented. Pre-HEAO results are reviewed, noting that (1) the relationship between velocity dispersion and X-ray temperature suggests that clusters truly possess their virial mass; (2) high-temperature clusters are generally more centrally condensed or contain proportionately more intergalactic gas; (3) there is an inverse correlation between percentage of spirals and the ram pressure experienced by an average galaxy in the cluster; and (4) the most central condensed clusters have higher X-ray temperatures, emission integrals and X-ray luminosities. Consideration is also given to HEAO-1 and HEAO-2 results. It is concluded that the X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies is due to a hot evolved intracluster gas with about 10% of the virial mass of the cluster. The X-ray gas is direct evidence of a virial mass in the cluster. The gas interacts with the galaxies and may change their morphology.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is noted that in the algorithm's principal rate controlled mode, image lines can be coded at selected rates by combining practical universal noiseless coding techniques with block adaptive adjustments in linear quantization. Compression of any source data at chosen rates of 3.0 bits/sample and above can be expected to yield visual image quality with imperceptible degradation. Exact reconstruction will be obtained if the one-dimensional difference entropy is below the selected compression rate. It is noted that the compressor can also be operated as a floating rate noiseless coder by simply not altering the input data quantization. Here, the universal noiseless coder ensures that the code rate is always close to the entropy.

III - VLA observations at 20 cm,"VLA radio maps and optical identifications of a sample of sources in the directions of 21 Yerkes poor cluster fields are presented. The majority of the cluster radio sources are associated with the dominant D or cD galaxies (approximately 70 percent). Our analysis of dominant galaxies in rich and poor clusters indicates that these giant galaxies are much more often radio emitters (approximately 25 percent of cD's are radio active in the poor clusters), have steeper radio spectra, and have simpler radio morphologies (i.e., double or other linear structure) than other less bright ellipticals. A strong continuum of radio properties in cD galaxies is seen from rich to poor clusters. It is speculated that the location of these dominant galaxies at the cluster centers (i.e., at the bottom of a deep, isolated gravitational potential well) is the crucial factor in explaining their multifrequency activity.

This mechanism explains, at least qualitatively, all the results of the earlier experimental study of the dependence of quartz crystal growth upon applied pressure: large negative activation volume; single activation enthalpy below Si-O bond energy; growth velocity constant in time, proportional to the hydroxyl and chlorine content, decreasing with increasing degree of reduction, and enhanced by nonhydrostatic stresses; lower pre-exponential for the synthetic than for the natural silica.",2013-08-11,1980-12-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The thermochemical data used are the experimentally determined enthalpies of mixing of the ternary liquids and the enthalpy of fusion of diopside. These are combined with a mixing model for the configurational entropy in the melt and the activity of CaMgSi2O6 in the clinopyroxene, which is less than unity due to departures from CaMgSi2O6 stoichiometry.

The inner mode is found to be unstable most of the time, while the excitation of the magnetopause mode depends on the magnetic field in the magnetosheath. The observed variation of the boundary layer thickness can be attributed to the unstable inner mode.

The landings occurred during local summer, and it was observed that the nocturnal temperature decrease at sensor height (1.6 m) did not exhibit a uniform behavior at either site. It was expected that the rate of decrease would gradually slow, leveling off near sunrise. Instead, a leveling occurred several hours earlier. Temperature subsequently began a more rapid decrease which slowed by sunrise. This suggested that the temperature sensors may be detecting the frost point of water vapor. Analysis of alternative hypotheses demonstrates that none of these are viable candidates. The frost point interpretation is consistent with other lander and orbiter observations, with terrestrial experience, and with modeling of Mars' atmospheric behavior.

Nine channels of data from the airborne scanner were evaluated to select the most useful spectral bands for discriminating among the land cover types associated with surface mines. Four bands were selected in the following order by a stepwise linear discriminant procedure: 0.60-0.65 micron, 0.92-1.10 microns, 0.80-0.89 micron, and 8-14 microns. The data corresponding to these four bands were used for the thematic mapping of land cover.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The mean velocity profile of a turbulent boundary layer consists of a viscous sublayer, buffer layer, and a logarithmic outer layer; an empirical formula of Coles (1956) applies to various pressure gradients. The boundary layer coherent structure was isolated by the correlation methods of Townsend (1956) and flow visualization by direct observations of complex unsteady turbulent motions. The near-wall studies of Willmart and Wooldridge (1962) used the space-time correlation for pressure fluctuations at the wall under a thick turbulent boundary layer; finally, organized motion in free shear flows and transition-control of mixing demonstrated that the Reynolds number invariance of turbulence shows wide scatter.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Different systems exhibit wide variations in the slope of the surprisal plot and in certain cases, enough to indicate that the energy gap may not be the static dynamical constraint. Similar analyses are presented for nonlinear rotors excited by atoms for H2CO-He and H2O-He. For these, the data show a great deal of scatter, indicating that the reduced energy gap is probably not the appropriate independent variable.",2013-08-11,1979-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The seismic moment, seismic energy release, annual seismic energy release, stress drop, and body-wave magnitude are determined for the largest shallow moonquakes and for large deep-focus events. It is found that the shallow events dominate the lunar seismic energy release, that tidal dissipation may account for the energy release by the deep-focus events, and that the stress drops for the deep-focus events are comparable to or smaller than the calculated tidal stresses.

The proposed experiment, designated the Shuttle Electrodynamic Tether Systems (SETS) is based on the concept of collecting electrons at the subsatellite and ejecting them from the Orbiter, made possible by the emf generated by the motion of the tether across geomagnetic field lines. The power generated in this manner can be used both for practical purposes within the Orbiter and for the creation of large-amplitude plasma and electromagnetic waves within the surrounding plasma. For a conducting spherical subsatellite 30 m in diameter with a 10-km tether drawing 1 A, calculations show that emfs on the order of 1000-2000 V and energy dissipation of as much as 10,000 W can be obtained, accompanied by the generation of two regions of net electric charge in the ionosphere.

In many cases macrosegregation is sufficient to prevent the plane front solidification of the alloy. The transition from dendritic to composite structure is found to occur when the composition of the solid is close enough to the eutectic composition to satisfy a stability criterion based on the ratio of the liquid temperature gradient to growth rate. A vertical or horizontal magnetic field of 0.1 T (1 kilogauss) does not reduce macrosegregation, but downward solidification (liquid below solid) virtually eliminates macrosegregation in small (3 mm) diameter samples.",2013-08-11,1981-02-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

In the conduct of a fluorescence lidar experiment, a number of parameters which can be used to optimize the SNR can be controlled. In this paper the optimum division of laser pulses centered on and off the fluorescence excitation wavelength is calculated as a function of the ratio of the fluorescence signal strength to the strength of fluorescence from interfering species. For strong interference signals the time should be divided equally on and off the line. For strong fluorescence signals the time on line is proportional to the square root of the on-line off-line signal ratio. The optimization of the integration time for varying values of signal-to-background and signal-to-interference ratios, atmospheric attenuation, laser energy variations, background measurement time, and on-line off-line time division is also considered.",2013-08-11,1981-02-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

With a sufficiently large negative bias applied to the electrode, incident visible light of intensity greater than about 1 microW/sq cm causes the reverse-biased junction to switch from a low-current to a high-current state. It is believed that hot-electron-induced impact ionization provides the positive feedback necessary for switching, and causes the junction to remain in its high-current state after the optical excitation is removed. The junction may be switched back to the low-current state electrically. The basic junction characteristics have been measured, and a simple model for the switching phenomenon has been developed.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The rate constant measured at 298 K is found to be somewhat faster than previously accepted values, with a negative temperature dependence.

With the use of simultaneous ground-based data, a value of 0.00001 is derived for the transition moment of the a 3 Pi-X 1 Sigma g + transition of C2. The anomalous CO(+)/CO2(+) ratio can be accounted for by the different scale lengths of the species rather than by an abundance difference.

Significant improvement in the gravitational model was obtained during the experiment, and it is pointed out that the current accuracy of the Seasat altitude ephemeris is 1.5 m rms. An altitude ephemeris for the Seasat spacecraft with an accuracy of 0.5 m rms is seen as possible with further improvements in the geopotential, atmospheric drag, and solar radiation pressure models.

It is found that the special Seasat gravity field PGS-S3 is most consistent with the data for three-day orbits, but an unmodeled systematic effect in radiation pressure is noted. For orbits of 18-day duration, little distinction can be made between the results derived from the PGS gravity fields.

Within the framework of small-perturbation linearization, the behavior of the vertical velocity and the horizontal divergence is analyzed at the discontinuity of the current shear. In the conventional geostrophic-type instability regime, the discontinuity in the horizontal divergence at the shear discontinuity is suppressed, and, therefore, the piecewise linear profile leads to a useful approximation to the true solution. In the symmetric-type instability regime, however, due to the magnified discontinuity in the horizontal divergence at the shear discontinuity, the solution thus obtained will show a major distortion, rendering the piecewise linear profile inadequate for modeling the smoothly-varying current profile. Using exemplary current profiles, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the horizontal divergence near the discontinuity of current shear.",2013-08-11,1980-12-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

These otoconia develop into spindle-shaped and, subsequently, dumbbell-shaped units. Transmission electron microscopy of dumbbell-shaped otoconia not exposed to fluids during embedment showed that calcite deposits mimicked the arrangement of the organic material.

Pressure profiles were measured by pitot probes downstream of a tip with a nearly constant surface pressure level and a nearly continuous surface curvature in a blowdown air tunnel operating at Mach 6. Rather than the simple three-dimensional quasi-parallel shear flow expected, the measurements indicated the presence of a flow with large deficits in longitudinal pitot pressure, which are usually associated with the core region of quasi-steady longitudinal vortices. Vapor screen flow visualizations also support the presence of longitudinal vortices located primarily in the tip region and evidently forming in the vicinity of the wake neck. An increase in overall wake thickness by 100% is also observed. The origin of the vortices as quasi-steady Taylor-Gortler vortices generated in the concavely curved shear layer near the wake neck is considered.

Taken as a whole, the results show that individual exponent differences do not decrease by counterbalancing magnitude estimation with magnitude production and that individual exponent differences remain stable over time despite changes in stimulus frequency. Further results show that although individual magnitude estimation and production exponents do not necessarily obey the .6 power law, it is possible to predict the slope of an equal-sensation function averaged for a group of listeners from individual magnitude estimation and production data. On the assumption that individual listeners with sensorineural hearing also produce stable and reliable magnitude functions, it is also shown that the slope of the loudness-recruitment function measured by magnitude estimation and production can be predicted for individuals with bilateral losses of long duration. Results obtained in normal and pathological ears thus suggest that individual listeners can produce loudness judgements that reveal, although indirectly, the input-output characteristic of the auditory system.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Horizontal eddy diffusivities must be at least ten-fold greater than vertical diffusivities. Anisotropy ratios greater than or approximately equal to 1,000 are sufficient to explain the flattening in cases where the vertical eddy diffusivity is greater than or approximately equal to 100,000 sq cm/s and the effects of radiative transfer are negligible. For vertical diffusivity greater than or approximately equal to 100,000 sq cm/s, radiative transfer contributes to the flattening.

It is estimated that the catalog will contain approximately a million objects having a brightness of 10 amtowatts per square centimeter or greater; 125,000 SDAS detections, if spurious events of signal-to-noise ratios greater than 2.5 are included, will be made every day.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810041573,INSTRUMENTATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY,Source detection for the infrared astronomical satellite,A recursive algorithm is described which detects and characterizes point sources and extended sources in the data obtained from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) in the presence of non-stationary noise. The analysis of tests using simulated data indicates that the performance of the point source detector is very close to that expected from a matched filter with stationary gaussian noise. The false alarm rate of the extended source detector tends to be higher than expected at a given SNR.,2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The concentric ring structure acts as a Fresnel lens and can be used to obtain excellent lateral focusing of ultrasonic waves. The trapping is sufficiently strong to permit optimization of electrode spacings to suppress spurious virtual foci and ring sidelobes.,2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The heavy saturation of the 8900 band as compared to the other bands indicates a gaseous origin for the observed absorptions. A total methane abundance of 80 + or - 20 m-am is derived, and an upper limit to the total pressure of approximately .05 atm is set. The methane atmosphere would be stable if the mass of Pluto is increased 50% over its present value and its radius is 1400 km.

19810041876,ASTRONOMY,The spectral flux distribution of the candidate BL Lacertae object 1218 + 304 /identically equal to 2A 1219 + 305/,"A break in the optical-infrared spectrum of the X-ray-discovered candidate BL Lac object 1218 + 304 has been observed at a wavelength of about 1 micron. Two possible causes of the break are considered. One is that it is a high-frequency break in a synchrotron spectrum, resulting from radiation losses. The other is that the observed spectrum is a composite of a power-law spectrum and a galaxian spectrum. The radio through X-ray spectral flux distributions of the two X-ray-discovered BL Lac objects, 1218 + 304 and 2155 - 304, are quite similar. If the radio, infrared, and optical radiation have a common origin in an inhomogeneous synchrotron source, then the observed slope of the X-ray spectrum makes it unlikely that the X-radiation is produced by Compton scattering. The observed soft X-radiation from BL Lac objects is better explained as the high-frequency tail of a synchrotron spectrum. The low radio:optical spectral-flux ratios of 1284 + 304 and 2155 - 304 suggest that this ratio may be inversely related to the break frequency for BL Lac objects. In that case, there may be BL Lac objects which have spectral breaks in the ultraviolet, flat optical spectra, and very weak radio emission. Such objects would most easily be discovered through their X-ray emission.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810041882,ASTRONOMY,The broad-band spectra and variability of compact nonthermal sources,"It is noted that in approximately a dozen sources, nearly simultaneous infrared and/or visual spectra are available, making it possible to examine the relationship between the infrared-visual and radio regimes. A simple transition to the steeper infrared spectra is seen as likely with a mean break wavelength of approximately 300 microns in the rest frame. These observations indicate a tapered source geometry, with the smallest structures roughly on the order of 10 to the 16th cm as estimated from the spectral break; this is consistent with scales estimated from optical variability time scales. Large amplitude variations on a six-month time interval are found to be fairly infrequent in most of the sources. A relatively model-independent way of categorizing flux variations as due to changes in source scale, or structure or the slope of the electron energy spectrum is suggested.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810041896,ASTROPHYSICS,The 35 day dependence of the pulse shape of Hercules X-1,"An interesting finding regarding the pulse shape change of Hercules X-1 is reported. By inspecting Her X-1 observations made by various detectors over various epochs, it is found that during the decay phase of the 35-day cycle high state the first-peak flux (of the double-peaked main pulse) is attenuated more than the second-peak flux. Accepting that the 35-day cycle is a consequence of the wobbling of the accretion disk, a model is proposed in which the first-peak emission and the second-peak emission emanate from two different emitting regions (two magnetic poles). According to this model, during the decay phase of the 35-day cycle the column density of the coronal gas along the line of sight to the first-peak emission region is greater than that to the second-peak emission region. Thus the Compton scattering attenuation of the first peak is larger at a given moment during the decay phase. Implications of the model are discussed.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810041911,ASTROPHYSICS,A model for dwarf novae as progenitors of Type I supernovae,"It is suggested that a Type I supernova event can be produced as a result of accretion at low rates (less than 10 to the -10th solar mass/year) onto the white dwarf component of a dwarf-nova close binary. At these low rates, diffusion of the CNO nuclei out of the accreted hydrogen envelope can occur on the accretion time scale, and nuclear burning will occur mainly by the proton-proton chain. Studies of this process show that, when the CNO abundance in the envelope is less than 0.0025 of solar, no thermonuclear flash occurs and no mass is lost. The result of the evolution is a gradually increasing layer of helium beneath the hydrogen-burning shell.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810042061,GEOPHYSICS,Dependence of tropospheric temperature on the parameterization of cumulus convection in the GLAS model of the general circulation,"Analysis of the simulation of seasonal change by the GLAS model of the general circulation reveals deficiencies in the simulation of tropospheric temperature and of convective cloud cover. These interrelated deficiencies are due to a spurious doubling from January to July in the convective cloud cover of the Northern Hemisphere. The spurious doubling, in turn, is due to the oversensitivity of cumulus convection, in the GLAS model, to the specific humidity of the lower atmosphere. The oversensitivity is enhanced by a feedback mechanism which perpetuates the existence of deep, penetrative convective clouds at certain preferred locations. The cumulus parameterization scheme has been modified to more realistically relate the onset of cumulus convection to the relative humidity of the lower atmosphere. The modified parameterization has improved the simulation of tropospheric temperature, planetary albedo and convective cloud cover as well as their seasonal variations. Comparison of this experiment with its control has shown a high degree of interrelation among these fields in the GLAS model and has demonstrated the sensitivity of the atmospheric heat budget to the design of the cumulus parameterization scheme. Also, the modification to the cumulus scheme has demonstrated a plausible mechanism to explain the correlation between convective cloud cover and relative humidity in the real atmosphere.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810042103,AERODYNAMICS,Large-eddy breakup scheme for turbulent viscous drag reduction,A concept for reducing turbulent skin friction drag by altering/controlling the large coherent eddy structures within the turbulent boundary layer is proposed. Results of an ongoing experimental and numerical investigation to develop large-eddy breakup devices (LEBU devices) are presented and indicate that the average skin friction drag downstream of the LEBU devices is reduced by up to 24% compared to 'undisturbed' flat plate levels; device drag requires further reduction before net drag reductions can be realized. Future work is discussed and will focus on reducing device drag by taking advantage of the unsteady 'freestream' ahead of the LEBU devices.,2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The manipulator was found to be effective in inhibiting the intermittent large scale structure of the boundary layer, and the effect persists for at least 70 boundary-layer thicknesses downstream of the manipulator. With the removal of the large scale, there was an observed reduction in the streamwise turbulence intensity levels near the wall. The downstream distribution of the skin friction coefficient, determined from the stream wise change in fluid momentum, was also altered by the introduction of the manipulator. The data from both the visualization and hot wire studies are provided.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Calculations for the effects of geometric and fluid variables on total wave drag are presented under the philosophy that trends will be nearly correct even though levels are probably incorrect.

The direct drag data indicate net drag reductions as large as 7% for certain V-groove riblets with heights in terms of law of the wall coordinates h+ less than 30. For one of the riblet models, the drag reduction is confirmed by reductions in the momentum thickness, turbulent velocity fluctuations, and Reynolds stress profiles. Although the direct drag data for the transverse curvature riblets showed drag increases, certain models did show that the drag increase diminished with increasing velocity. This trend is opposite to the normal one found for rough surfaces and should be investigated further.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is concluded that current research has eroded still further the experimental data base which indicates drag reduction on compliant surfaces under turbulent boundary layers in air.

It is found that all the Be/shell stars whose spectral types are later than B6 exhibit greatly enhanced line absorption due to circumstellar Fe II. The circumstellar gaseous line absorption in stars cooler than B6 severely complicates the study of circumstellar dust absorption. However, those B and A stars that exhibit the circumstellar 9.7-micron emission feature have a very large increase in circumstellar absorption for 1800 A; such absorption is expected from circumstellar silicate particles.",2013-08-11,1981-05-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

19810050863,ASTRONOMY,A survey of X-ray line emission from the supernova remnant Puppis A,"Initial results from the first high-resolution study of the X-ray spectrum of a supernova remnant are reported. The spectrum of Puppis A between 500 and 1100 eV has been surveyed with the Focal Plane Crystal Spectrometer on the Einstein Observatory and the flux in eight lines and three line blends from various transitions of highly ionized nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and iron has been measured. The spectrum resembles that of active regions in the solar corona, but the neon lines seem enhanced relative to the oxygen lines, and both are enhanced relative to iron. The observed line strengths serve as diagnostics of the physical conditions in the emitting material. Without a priori assumptions, the ionization temperatures of O (2.2 million K) and Ne (4 million K) and the dominant ionization stage of Fe (Fe XVII) are deduced. Isothermal equilibrium plasmas or homogeneous nonequilibrium plasmas as descriptions of the source are ruled out. It is concluded that Puppis A must contain plasma over a temperature range 2-million to 5-million K with an intervening absorption column of 4 x 10 to the 21st/sq cm.",2013-08-11,1981-05-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

19810050892,COMPOSITE MATERIALS,Sudden bending of a cracked laminate,"The intensification of stresses near a through crack in the laminate that suddenly undergoes bending is investigated. A dynamic plate theory is developed which includes the effects of material inhomogeneity in the thickness direction and realistic crack edge stress singularity and distribution. Numerical examples indicate that (1) the crack moment intensity tends to decrease as the crack length to laminate thickness is increased, and (2) the average load intensity transmitted to a through crack can be reduced by making the inner layers to be stiffer than the outer layers.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The transition regions are found to be complex in character, consisting of intermediate average field orientations in some cases as well as a number of large-angle directional discontinuities (DDs). It is suggested that the observed DDs represent multiple traversals of the global heliospheric current sheet caused by local fluctuations in the position of the sheet. There is evidence that such fluctuations are sometimes produced by wavelike motions or surface corrugations of scale length 0.05-0.1 AU, superimposed on the large-scale structure.",2013-08-11,1981-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810050978,GEOPHYSICS,The ultraviolet dayglow. IV - The spectrum and excitation of singly ionized oxygen,"The emission line spectrum of singly ionized atomic oxygen (O II) dominates the day airglow spectrum in the extreme ultraviolet below 834 A. The strongest resonance line, at 834 A, is optically thick and an analysis of height profiles obtained from rocket observations between 140 and 265 km in specific viewing directions indicates that the principal excitation source is direct photoionization of neutral atomic oxygen. Strong emission at 538-539 A is most likely due to the quartet rather than the doublet transitions, which both occur at these wavelengths and which are not spectrally resolved in the data. The intensities of the weaker lines are consistent with recent laboratory measurements of transition branching ratios. Several strong O II lines near He I 584 produce severe contamination of low-altitude (less than 400 km) measurements of geocoronal helium emission made with thin-film broadband photometers.",2013-08-11,1981-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051141,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,Containerless undercooling and solidification in drop tubes,"A containerless low-gravity environment, produced within a 32 m drop tube apparatus, has been used to undercool and solidify metals, alloys or glasses by eliminating crucible induced nucleation processes. Niobium droplets with diameters in the range of 2 to 5 mm have been undercooled by 525 K which corresponds to the maximum undercooling reported by Turnbull and others on fine dispersions of low melting point metals. Solidification at large undercooling resulted in single crystalline spheres with the formation of interdendritic shrinkage channels on the sample surface rather than interior shrinkage cavities. The grain refinement as observed for Ni samples undercooled and solidified in fused silica crucibles does not occur in free-falling drops of Nb. A calculated solidification speed of undercooled Nb is compared to Ni. A solidification speed of 320 m/s is found for the Nb drops. This solidification speed is greater than or comparable to the solidification speeds calculated in splat cooled samples. Thus, a drop tube apparatus can be useful in the preparation and study of high temperature metastable compounds or alloys in bulk form.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051143,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,The direct observation of unidirectional solidification as a function of gravity level,"A saturated solution of NH4 Cl-H2O was solidified unidirectionally on earth at 1 g and in a suborbital rocket at 0.001 g. In the 1 g experiment, extensive fluid flow was apparent, creating plumes which carry numerous crystallites vertically above the interface in a manner associated with freckling in castings. During growth the interface grew into the liquid at the same rate as the individual dendrites. When solidified in low g, the interface grew at a slower rate than the individual dendrites. No plumes of liquid carrying crystals were seen, but several crystals did appear and grow ahead of the interface. Growth rates, dendrite morphologies and preferred crystallographic orientations are compared for the two experiment conditions. Results indicate that solidification in low gravity produces more uniform dendrite arm spacings, and tends to be controlled by diffusion and crystallographic orientation.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051146,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,Analysis of forced convection heat flow effects in horizontal ribbon growth from the melt,A heat transport analysis which considers forced convective fluid flow induced by the motion of a continuous solid ribbon over a melt has been done for horizontal ribbon growth. A model has been developed which treats both 'active' and 'passive' cooling at the ribbon surface. The results show that heat flow from the melt requires active cooling in the region of the leading growth edge or growth tip. Steady-state liquid-solid interface shape is analyzed and numerical results are given for steady-state pulling of silicon ribbon.,2013-08-11,1980-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The potential benefits and operating problems of the more promising concepts are discussed. Recent flight-test results are presented which show that essentially total vortex alleviation can be achieved at a 3 nautical mile separation distance by oscillating the aircraft's lateral-control surfaces. While not operationally practical, these results suggest that it may be possible to minimize the wake hazard by exciting longitudinal instabilities.",2013-08-11,1981-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051428,GEOPHYSICS,The first 800 million years of earth's history,"It is pointed out that there is no direct geological information on the first 750 Ma of earth history. Consequently the reported study is based on controversial inferences drawn from the moon, other planets and meteorites, coupled with backward extrapolation from surviving terrestrial rocks, especially those of Archaean age. Aspects of accretion are considered, taking into account cosmochemical and cosmophysical evidence, a new earth model, and convection systems. Attention is given to phase-equilibrium constraints, estimates of heat production, the bombardment history of the moon and implications for the earth, and the nature of the early crust. From a combination of physical, chemical, and petrological arguments, it is concluded that the earth's surface underwent intense volcanism in the pre-Archaean era, and that the rock types were chemically similar to those found in the early Archaean era.",2013-08-11,1981-05-15,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051457,GEOPHYSICS,The gravity field in the central Pacific from satellite-to-satellite tracking,"Satellite-to-satellite Doppler tracking between the ATS 6 and the GEOS 3 spacecraft was used to measure the high-degree and high-order gravity field over an 80-deg region in the central Pacific Ocean. Forty passes of GEOS 3/ATS 6 Doppler data have been analyzed. The precision of these range rate data is about 0.3 mm/s, and the line-of-sight gravity anomalies recovered from these data have a precision of about 0.2 mGal at the GEOS 3 altitude of about 840 km. In general, the agreement between the SST-derived map and the conventional GEM method and an altimeter-derived geoid is good. Eight significant positive gravity anomalies were exposed in the central Pacific. Generally speaking, the anomalies form a roughly east-west pattern of alternating sign in the central region, and near the East Pacific they strike about north and south.",2013-08-11,1981-05-10,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051588,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Erosion of Galilean satellite surfaces by Jovian magnetosphere particles,"The effects on the surfaces of the Galilean satellites Europa, Ganymede and Callisto of impacts by particles of the Jupiter magnetosphere in which they are immersed are estimated. Differential ion fluxes measured by the Voyager low-energy magnetosphere particle analyzer as a function of ion energy were used to calculate ice erosion fluxes for the satellites under the assumption that each is 50% ice covered. Calculations were performed on the basis of laboratory data concerning the ice sputtering coefficients of protons and oxygen ions of various energies. A water erosion rate of greater than 10 to the 10th/sq cm per sec is obtained for Europa, which implies a total erosion over 1 billion years of an ice layer 100 m deep. Atmospheric column densities of the H2O molecules sputtered from the surface but not escaping the satellites are also calculated for the three satellites assuming a sputtered ion temperature of 2000 K, and are found to dominate those produced by sublimation. Finally, estimates are presented of the source and loss processes for an oxygen atmosphere around Ganymede created by sputtering or sublimation.",2013-08-11,1981-05-29,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051663,PLASMA PHYSICS,Bodies in flowing plasmas - Laboratory studies,"A brief review of early rudimentary laboratory studies of bodies in flowing, rarefied plasmas is presented (e.g., Birkeland, 1908), along with a discussion of more recent parametric studies conducted in steady plasma wind tunnels, which includes the study by Hall et al. (1964), in which a strong ion density enhancement in the center of the ion void created downstream from the body was observed. Good agreement was found between the experimental results and theoretical calculations which omit ion thermal motion. Examples in which in situ data on the interaction between satellites and the ionospheric plasma have been elucidated by the laboratory results are presented, and include evidence for a midwake axial ion peak, and ion current density in the near-wake region. The application of the ionospheric laboratory to basic space plasma physics is discussed, and its application to some types of solar system plasma phenomena is illustrated.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051694,SOLAR PHYSICS,Determination of solar proton fluxes and energies at high solar latitudes by UV radiation measurements,"The latitudinal variation of the solar proton flux and energy causes a density increase at high solar latitudes of the neutral gas penetrating the heliosphere. Measurements of the neutral density by UV resonance radiation observations from interplanetary spacecraft thus permit deductions on the dependence of the solar proton flux on heliographic latitude. Using both the results of Mariner 10 measurements and of other off-ecliptic solar wind observations, the values of the solar proton fluxes and energies at polar heliographic latitudes are determined for several cases of interest. The Mariner 10 analysis, together with IPS results, indicate a significant decrease of the solar proton flux at polar latitudes.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051731,GEOPHYSICS,Measurements of the earth radiation budget from satellites during the first GARP global experiment,"Radiation budget data (which will aid in climate model development) and solar constant measurements (both to be used for the study of long term climate change and interannual seasonal weather variability) are presented, obtained during Nimbus-6 and Nimbus-7 satellite flights, using wide-field-of-view, scanner, and black cavity detectors. Data on the solar constant, described as a function of the date of measurement, are given. The unweighed mean amounts to 1377 + or - 20 per sq Wm, with a standard deviation of 8 per sq Wm. The new solar data are combined with earlier measurements, and it is suggested that the total absolute energy output of the sun is a minimum at 'solar maximum' and vice versa. Attention is given to the measurements of the net radiation budget, the planetary albedo, and the infrared radiant exitance. The annual and semiannual cycles of normal variability explain most of the variance of energy exchange between the earth and space. Examination of separate ocean and atmospheric energy budgets implies a net continent-ocean region energy exchange.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051768,ASTRODYNAMICS,Analysis of Lageos' altitude decrease,"The paper treats the inverse problem of celestial mechanics which consists of determining the force field or potential from given or observed orbit(s). From the observational information, according to which Lageos loses approximately 1 mm altitude per day, a linear partial differential equation is formulated. The solution of this equation gives the field responsible for the above-mentioned, as yet unexplained, small but well established secular decrease in the semi-major axis. Note that the altitude-loss is not due to air-drag because of the very high altitude of this satellite.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051786,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Interiors of the giant planets - Recent advances,It is shown that new experimental evidence that the molecular to metallic transition in hydrogen takes place near 2 Mb rather than 3 Mb affects only slightly the current models of Jupiter but a more radical change has to be noted for the model of Saturn. Magnetic field and luminosity data indicate that in this planet the metallic H-He layer is actually split into an inhomogeneous upper layer and an He-rich lower layer. The recent three-layer model of Uranus accounts better for various observational constraints than the previous models despite the uncertainty about the planet's rotation period. The models of the interior of Neptune are still rather uncertain.,2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051823,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Absorbers seen near the Venus cloud tops from Pioneer Venus,"Pioneer Venus Orbiter measurements of planetary contrast at the Venus cloud tops are discussed. Images of the cloud tops at wavelengths between 1990 and 3400 A were obtained by the Pioneer UV Spectrometer together with broadband imagery and polarimetry at 2700 and 3650 A from the Orbiter Cloud Photopolarimeter at Venus phase angles of 33 to 130 deg. The planet is found to be darkest at the point where the UV Spectrometer line of sight penetrates perpendicular to the cloud tops, indicating that the absorbing material must be deep in the atmosphere. The contrast observed at wavelengths shortward of 3200 A is explained by SO2 absorption in the dark regions, while the persistence of the contrast at longer wavelengths requires the presence of an additional absorber or absorbers closely associated with the SO2, and a haze of submicron particles overlying the cloud tops in the bright regions. The correlations found between contrast and polarization indicate that no single constituent or change in vertical structure can account for the UV contrast. The origin of the markings is instead explained by a model in which absorbers subject to photochemical destruction are mixed upward into the cloud top region.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051835,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Upper atmosphere of Jupiter - A post Voyager perspective,"Some significant upper atmosphere features of Jupiter are discussed with reference to the Voyager observations of 1979. From the time of Pioneer observations in 1973-1974, the Jovian upper atmospheric temperature has increased by about 30%, the eddy diffusion coefficient at the homopause decreased by a factor of 100, the equatorial disk Lyman alpha intensity increased by a factor of 30, and the equatorial ionosphere became more extensive and showed diurnal variation. Important potential candidates for upper atmosphere energetics are thought to be the penetration of the magnetospheric soft electrons, Joule heating mechanism, and auroral electrons.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051855,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Microwave response of vegetation,"The radar backscatter behavior is discussed as a function of the vegetation geometrical and electrical properties. Experimental data covering the 1-18 GHz region are used to model the vegetation canopy as a water cloud, evaluate the attenuation of the canopy, and generate a vegetation clutter model describing the statistical distribution of vegetation backscatter under a wide range of environmental conditions. The use of radar in conjunction with optical sensors for crop identification is then discussed. Analysis of studies conducted to date indicates that the observation angle should be in the 50-70 deg range (from nadir) and the frequency should be higher than 8 GHz.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051863,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Microwave response of snow,"Truck-mounted microwave sensors were used to acquire backscattering coefficient and apparent temperature data for snow-covered terrain at 19 frequencies between 1 and 18 GHz and at 35.6 GHz. Passive microwave measurements were made at 10.7, 37, and 94 GHz. The radar backscattering coefficient and radiometric emissivity were evaluated as a function of snow depth, wetness, surface roughness, and other snow parameters. It is shown that volume scattering makes the radar backscattering coefficient to increase and the radiometric emissivity to decrease with increasing snow depth until the snow layer appears electromagnetically semiinfinite in extent. The presence of liquid water in the snowpack results in increased attenuation and reduction in scattering which leads to less backscatter and more emission by the snow volume. It is concluded that microwave sensors have the potential capability for remotely monitoring both the snow equivalent and wetness of snowpacks.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810051975,SOLAR PHYSICS,X-ray and gamma-ray observations of a white-light flare,"Hard radiations (X-ray and gamma-ray) from a major solar flare observed by HEAO-1 on July 11, 1978, are discussed. It is noted that the observations showed gamma-ray line and continuum emission extending to the highest energy observed. The lines are identified with the 2.2 MeV line of deuterium formation and the 4.4 MeV line of inelastic scattering on C-12, both of which were previously observed in the flares of August 1972. The flare of July 11 is identified as a white-light flare. It therefore provides the first opportunity for a detailed examination of white-light flare theories that depend on proton heating of the photosphere. The line strength over a four-minute integration at 2.2 MeV is found to be 1.00 + or - 0.29 ph/sq cm-sec; the gamma-ray emission (excluding the 2.2 MeV line which was appreciably delayed) lagged by less than 20 sec approximately after the hard X-ray and microwave fluxes. It is concluded that the 'second-stage' acceleration of high-energy solar particles must commence promptly after the impulsive phase.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810052108,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Erasure decoding in burst-error channels,A proven means of communicating reliably in a burst-error channel is the code interleaving scheme. Code symbols from a number of component codes are interleaved before being sent through the channel. This method effectively distributes the error detection and correction burden among the component codes and makes errors occurring in a codeword from each component code more or less independent. Erasure decoding techniques allow further refinement on the code interleaving concept. Their application leads to improved overall code performance when the symbol depth of the lead code is shallow compared to the average error-burst length of the channel. Theoretical formulations derived for predicting the performance of separate decoding and erasure decoding schemes are valuable in providing reasonably good estimates on redundancy requirements of the component codes.,2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19810052214,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,On numerical nonlinear analysis of highly flexible spinning cantilevers,The general nonlinear discretized equations of motion of spinning elastic solids and structures are derived as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the case when the strain-displacement and velocity-displacement relations are nonlinear up to the second order. It is shown that the cost of generation of such equations is proportional to the fourth power of the number of degrees of freedom. A computer program is written to automatically generate the equations for the case of spinning cantilevers with initial imperfections. The types and the number of the coordinate functions used in the trial solution are parameters of the program.,2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Visible light scatter measurements, using a computer controlled scanner, are made of various mirror samples to determine surface roughness. Total diffuse scatter is calculated using numerical integration techniques and used to estimate the rms surface roughness. The data measurements are then compared with X-ray scatter measurements of the same samples. A summary of the data generated is presented, along with graphs showing changes in scatter on samples before and after cleaning. Results show that very smooth surfaces can be polished on the common substrate materials (from 2 to 10 Angstroms), and nickel appears to give the lowest visible light scatter.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The composition and thermal properties of the nucleus determine the evolution of the more familiar and often spectacular cometary features, the coma and tail. Under certain circumstances, the nucleus may be obscured by a dust cloud of much higher temperature. The most appropriate technology for the investigation of the surface and subsurface layers of the nucleus is considered to be millimeter-wave sensing from an interplanetary spacecraft. Simple radiative transfer models, adapted from methods employed for the interpretation of remote-sensing data on terrestrial ice and snow fields, are used to predict the millimeter-wave spectra of representative model nuclei. The spectra determine the choice of the minimum set of observing frequencies that is required. An instrument configuration driven by these requirements and guided by available technology and the restraints of a proposed NASA spacecraft is then derived.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810052623,GEOPHYSICS,Deconvolution of wide field-of-view radiometer measurements of earth-emitted radiation. II - Analysis of first year of Nimbus 6 ERB data,"The theory of deconvolution considered by Smith and Green (1981) is applied to Nimbus 6 data in order to interpret the data with the maximum obtainable resolution. Attention is given to the data sample, sun-contaminated measurements, the measurement model, the deconvolution, the degree variance, the spherical harmonic coefficients, the geographical distribution of longwave radiation, time histories of zonal coefficients, and the effect of a grid system. Degree variance plots for 12 months of longwave radiation data show that the limit for a spherical harmonic representation of the Nimbus 6 wide field-of-view longwave data is 12th degree. The degree variance plots also reveal that most of the power is in the lower degree terms.

19810052634,GEOPHYSICS,The secondary flow near a baroclinic planetary wave critical line,"A critical line (CL) is the surface where the phase speed of a wave in a fluid is equal to the speed of the background flow. The considered investigation is concerned with one aspect of the simplest model of a CL in which the CL is assumed to totally absorb energy from steady, stationary, planetary waves. The aspect of interest is the secondary mean circulation near a CL in a baroclinic atmosphere. The motivation for this study is the observation of the nearly vertical CL by O'Neill and Taylor (1979) which appeared during the sudden warming of 1976/77. Even though the treatment of the CL is highly idealized in the investigation, there is evidence which indicates a very large rate of change in the zonally averaged temperature along a CL may occur. The Lagrangian-mean properties of an idealized baroclinic CL are also examined. It is found that the Lagrangian jets may provide an important transport process for exchange of stratospheric and tropospheric air.",2013-08-11,1981-03-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The screen hole plasma sheath (the transition region wherein significant ion acceleration and complete electron retardation occurs) has been defined by equipotential plots for a variety of ion accelerator system geometries and operating conditions. It was found that the screen hole plasma sheath extends over a large distance, and influences ion and electron trajectories at least 15 Debye lengths within the discharge chamber. The electron density variation within the screen hole plasma sheath satisfied a Maxwell-Boltzmann density distribution at an effective electron temperature dependent on the discharge plasma primary-to-Maxwellian electron density ratio. Plasma ion flow up to and through the sheath was predominantly one-dimensional, and the ions entered the sheath region with a modified Bohm velocity. Low values of the screen grid thickness to screen hole diameter ratio were found to give good ion focusing and high extracted ion currents because of the effect of screen webbing on ion focusing.",2013-08-11,1981-04-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

This paper discusses the scientific constraints on and the requirements for pointing and controlling SIRTF as well as several aspects of SIRTF orbital operations. The basic pointing requirement is for an rms stability of 0.25 arcsec, which is necessary to realize the full angular resolution of the 5-micron diffraction-limited SIRTF. Achieving this stability requires the use of hardware and software integral to SIRTF working interactively with the gyrostabilized Shuttle pointing-mount. The higher sensitivity of SIRTF, together with orbital and time constraints, puts a premium on rapid target acquisition and on efficient operational and observational procedures. Several possible acquisition modes are discussed, and the importance of source acquisition by maximizing the output of an infrared detector is emphasized.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Scientific goals of the experiment dictate pointing stability requirements of less than 0.05 arcsecond jitter over periods of 5-20 seconds. Quantitative derivations of these requirements from two different aspects are presented: (1) avoidance of motion blurring of diffraction-limited images; (2) precise coalignment of consecutive frames to allow measurement of small image differences. To achieve this stability, a fine guider system capable of removing residual jitter of the IPS and image motions generated on the IPS cruciform instrument support structure has been constructed. This system uses solar limb detectors in the prime focal plane to derive an error signal. Image motion due to pointing errors is compensated by the agile secondary mirror mounted on piezoelectric transducers, controlled by a closed-loop servo system.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The methods for estimating the characteristics include a second-order shock expansion and panel method (MISLIFT), a slender body and 'first-order' panel method (APAS), and a 'higher-order' panel method for linearized supersonic flow (PAN AIR). The results show that PAN AIR provides accurate estimates of these characteristics at moderate angles of attack for complete configurations with either single or twin vertical tails. APAS provides estimates for complete configurations at zero angle of attack. However, MISLIFT only provides estimates for the simplest body-vertical tail configurations at zero angle of attack.",2013-08-11,1981-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The efficiency of the coupled analysis methods and the method of coupling has resulted in a uniquely efficient analysis tool. The airfoil geometry is modified by the displacement thickness before the shock and the displacement thickness plus the viscous wedge thickness after the shock by considering the viscous effects as an equivalent transpiration boundary condition. The flow about conventional and supercritical airfoils under moderately strong shock situations has been calculated. Comparisons with experimental data indicate that this viscous correction method has improved the accuracy of the full-potential analysis.

Servicing and instrument changes would be made at 2-yr intervals. It is pointed out that the LAT would have to be placed above the earth's atmosphere to avoid both the absorption that occurs through much of the infrared and submillimeter and the turbulence which limits spatial resolution. Important technical considerations for the LAT are discussed; they include the telescope optical form, the primary mirror material, figure control techniques, the deployment techniques, and thermal control.

This paper proposes a new design method for overcoming this difficulty. The controller to be used employs a sampler and holding device with exponential decay. It is shown that the transmission zeros of the discretized system can be shifted by changing the rate of the exponential decay of the holding device. Thus, it is possible to design a robust controller for the discretized system to track any reference signal of given frequency, even if the given frequency coincides with the transmission zeros of the original continuous-time system.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

An intergalactic medium (IGM) that satisfies the observational constraints may now have a density with respect to closure of approximately 0.1, which is substantially less than hitherto modeled. The aggregate of QSO data also indicate that if evolution is due to number density, then, when split into luminosity classes, an exponential in look-back time fits the data better than a power law, and the evolution rates increase roughly with absolute luminosity if analyzed by the exponential.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810053450,ASTROPHYSICS,Vertical extensions of galactic spiral arms,"The vertical structure of the large scale galactic shock along spiral arms is studied in order to understand the extended features or the wings of spiral arms observed by Kepner (1970) and recently checked by Soukup (1979). Numerical calculations of two-dimensional gas flow were performed for two models of the gas. The results show that the shock front, standing perfectly perpendicular to the galactic plane, extends impressively above the scale height of the interstellar gas. In the extreme case of isothermal gas, the shock solution exists at any distance from the plane. In a realistic model in which the kinetic temperature of the gas is stratified, increasing with height, the shock can extend up to 700 pc. For both models, although the velocity component perpendicular to the galactic plane is small, the solutions corresponding to layered one-dimensional flow contain no shocks at such heights. In order to study the geometry of the shock front and the flow pattern near it, a simplified model is adopted, in which the Coriolis force is neglected. However, estimates show that including it will enhance the shock strength. The compression at the shock front makes the gas observable at high latitudes.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

III - The S235 molecular cloud,"The molecular cloud associated with the S235 H II region has been studied by means of molecular lines and near-infrared observations. The cloud consists of two components, one of which partly surrounds the S235 H II region. The other component contains a dense, hot region of active star formation, marked by self-reversed CO profiles, compact H II regions, masers, and infrared sources. From the molecular line data, the size and mass of the two components are estimated to be 6-8 pc and 3000-4000 solar masses. More detailed studies near the region of active star formation yield estimates of density (approximately 200,000-500,000/cu cm) and the abundances of H2CO, HCO(+), HCN, and (C-13)O. Analysis of the energetics suggests that the cloud is heated by the exciting star of S235 and by the exciting stars of the compact H II regions. Assuming that the gas is heated by collisions with warm dust grains, the far-infrared luminosity has been predicted.

The solution obtained illustrates the roles played by the electric current, magnetic field, pressure, and plasma weight in the balance of force everywhere in space. A specific example of a filament of diameter 50,000 km, with a density two orders of magnitude over the corona and supported by a magnetic field of about 4 gauss is included. The filament temperature can take values ranging from a small fraction to a few times the coronal temperature, depending on the internal electric current of the filament. To produce a cool filament, such as the quiescent prominence, the solution is required to have an internal field with a strong component along the filament, giving rise to helical structures. A hot filament such as the X-ray coronal loop can be produced as a twisted magnetic flux tube embedded in a strong background field aligned parallel to the filament and having lower density and temperature. The basic steps of construction can be used to develop models more realistic than the ones presented for their analytic simplicity.",2013-08-11,1981-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The inlet models, which were installed on a 20-inch diameter fan unit, had different inlet lip contraction ratios as well as unslotted, slotted, and double slotted inlet lips. The inlet angle-of-attack boundaries for onset of flow separation were identified and compared to the operating requirements of several generically different subsonic V/STOL aircraft. The zero-length inlets, especially those with slotted lips, were able to satisfy these requirements without compromising the maximum cowl forebody radius.

The results indicate that the mechanism which prevents antimisting fuel breakup is related to the time-dependent tensile viscosity of antimisting fuel under stress. Drag reduction phenomenon was also observed at Reynolds numbers higher than 20,000. Uptake of water by the antimisting fuel is higher than that for the neat fuel.

Spectrograms of RNO 90 in the blue and red have also been obtained, which show that it is a T Tauri star. Both stars have strong infrared excesses, placing them firmly in the 'dust' position of the H - K, K - L diagram. The absorption reversals superimposed on the Balmer lines from H-alpha to H-delta in RNO 90 display an interesting effect. They appear to move progressively redward from a position near the blue edge of the emission line at H-alpha to a nearly central location at H-delta. L 43 is located near the star-forming end of the Sco OB2 association, but is relatively isolated from the major center of activity, the Rho Oph cloud.

19810058297,FLUID MECHANICS AND HEAT TRANSFER,A study of the viscous and nonadiabatic flow in radial turbines,"A method for analyzing the viscous nonadiabatic flow within turbomachine rotors is presented. The field analysis is based upon the numerical integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations together with the energy equation over the rotors blade-to-blade stream channels. The numerical code used to solve the governing equations employs a nonorthogonal boundary fitted coordinate system that suits the most complicated blade geometries. Effects of turbulence are modeled with two equations; one expressing the development of the turbulence kinetic energy and the other its dissipation rate. The method of analysis is applied to a radial inflow turbine. The solution obtained indicates the severity of the complex interaction mechanism that occurs between different flow regimes (i.e., boundary layers, recirculating eddies, separation zones, etc.). Comparison with nonviscous flow solutions tend to justify strongly the inadequacy of using the latter with standard boundary layer techniques to obtain viscous flow details within turbomachine rotors.

The angles of attack, sideslip, roll, pitch, and yaw are derived from measurements of angular velocity and linear acceleration. The key to the success of this approach is to simultaneously estimate both the biases in the instrumentation and the initial conditions. Techniques for determining stability derivatives from flight data are applied to angles of attack too high for stabilized flight. This practice greatly expands the range over which aerodynamic characteristics can be determined from flight test. Nonlinear terms in certain aerodynamic functions are shown to be valid by comparing them with the trends of results at different angles of attack. A very old technique of studying spins is extended and applied to some modern light airplanes.

Hybrid combinations of graphite tape and cloth, glass cloth, and resin additives were studied with epoxy and polyimide resin systems. Polyimide resins formed the most resistant composites and resins based on simple novolac epoxies the least resistant of those tested. Great improvement in the containment of the fibers was obtained using graphite/glass hybrids, and nearly complete prevention of individual fiber release was made possible by the use of resin additives.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810059266,ENGINEERING (GENERAL),Design with brittle materials - An interdisciplinary educational program,"A series of interdisciplinary design courses being offered to senior and graduate engineering students at the University of Washington is described. Attention is given to the concepts and some of the details on group design projects that have been undertaken during the past two years. It is noted that ceramic materials normally demonstrate a large scatter in strength properties. As a consequence, when designing with these materials, the conventional 'mil standards' design stresses with acceptable margins of safety cannot by employed and the designer is forced to accept a probable number of failures in structures of a given brittle material. It is this prediction of the probability of failure for structures of given, well-characterized materials that forms the basis for this series of courses.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The objectives were to determine: (1) the optimum number of wavebands to utilize in computer classifications of TM data; (2) which channel combinations provide the highest expected classification accuracy; and (3) the relative merit of each channel in the context of the cover classes examined. Transformed divergence was used as a measure of statistical distance between spectral class densities associated with each of twelve cover classes.

At 92 GHz, video responsivities were typically 80 A/W (corrected for RF mismatch). Conversion loss (corrected for both RF and IF mismatches) was typically not less than 18 dB. As expected, diode temperature was low (less than 5 K). Video responsivity and conversion loss were also measured at an RF frequency of 3.95 GHz. These data were used with the measured volt-ampere characteristics of the diodes to compare theoretical predictions of diode performance at 92 GHz, in both the video and mixing modes, with the high-frequency data",2013-08-11,1981-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

(1976) have been reanalyzed in terms of both isothermal models and temperature distribution models. In the latter case, a power-law form is assumed for the relation between emission measure and temperature. A new upper limit on diffuse flux in the 20-73 eV band derived from Apollo-Soyuz observations made in the earth's shadow has been incorporated in the calculation. In the considered investigation the results of the new analysis are presented and the implications for the physical properties of the hot component of the interstellar medium are discussed. The analysis of the Berkeley extreme ultraviolet (EUV) diffuse background measurements using either isothermal or power law temperature distribution models for the emitting plasma indicates excellent qualitative agreement with hard X-ray data that suggest the sun to be immersed in a hot plasma that pervades most of space out to approximately 100 pc.",2013-08-11,1981-07-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The four spectra, obtained in the springs of 1979 and 1980, show emissions (about 40R) of S II A1256A and S III A1199A. An unidentified feature is also present at 1729 A; a tentative identification as an intercombination line of S III is proposed. Weak features, probably due to O III A1664A and S IV A1406A, appear in some of the spectra. Abundances of the ions are determined from the brightnesses of the observed features. Upper limits are also set for the abundances of a number of ionic and neutral species. An observation of Io itself does not show any additional or enhanced spectral features, permitting upper limits to be set on the injection rate for a number of species.",2013-08-11,1981-07-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19810059479,METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,The effects of surface evaporation parameterizations on climate sensitivity to solar constant variations,"The effects of two different evaporation parameterizations on the sensitivity of simulated climate to solar constant variations are investigated by using a zonally averaged climate model. One parameterization is a nonlinear formulation in which the evaporation is nonlinearly proportional to the sensible heat flux, with the Bowen ratio determined by the predicted vertical temperature and humidity gradients near the earth's surface (model A). The other is the formulation of Saltzman (1968) with the evaporation linearly proportional to the sensible heat flux (model B). The computed climates of models A and B are in good agreement except for the energy partition between sensible and latent heat at the earth's surface. The difference in evaporation parameterizations causes a difference in the response of temperature lapse rate to solar constant variations and a difference in the sensitivity of longwave radiation to surface temperature which leads to a smaller sensitivity of surface temperature to solar constant variations in model A than in model B. The results of model A are qualitatively in agreement with those of the general circulation model calculations of Wetherald and Manabe (1975).",2013-08-11,1981-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The data, from the TIROS-N Microwave Sounding Unit, are sensitive to lower stratospheric temperatures (30-150 mb). The results reveal striking temperature anomalies with short meridional wavelengths (2000-3000 km) and long zonal wavelengths (zonal wavenumbers 1-4). The anomalies, with amplitudes approximately 1-2 K, extend from the equatorial region to at least as high as 70 deg N and 70 deg S during January 1979. The features exhibit slow eastward movement or else are nearly stationary for several days. In the Northern Hemisphere, comparison with NMC data reveals that the strongest features tend to be associated with major jet streams.",2013-08-11,1981-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Two of the models are canard-wing configurations and one has a wing leading-edge extension (LEX) as the forward lifting surface. Data are taken from wind-tunnel tests of each model covering Mach numbers from 0.4 to 1.4. Overall lift and drag characteristics of these models and the generally favorable interactions of the forward surfaces with the wings are highlighted. Results indicate that larger LEX's and canards generally give greater lift and drag improvements than ones that are smaller relative to the wings.,2013-08-11,1981-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Emphasis is put on a type of event characterized by abrupt, dispersionless changes in electron intensity and a coincident perturbation that consists of both a field magnitude increase and a small rotation toward more dipolar orientation. Comparing plasma observations at two points, it is found that in active, preinjection conditions the two most important features of the plasma sheet are: (1) the low-energy convection boundary for near-zero energy particles, determined by the magnitude of the large-scale convection electric field; and (2) the precipitation-flow boundary layer between the hot plasma sheet and the atmospherically contaminated inner plasma sheet.",2013-08-11,1981-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is shown that the electron spectra can be represented by a power law in the range 0.2-26.0 keV, with the spectral index close to -1.0, and that the mean energy flux carried by electrons in the middle of the anomaly is about 0.003 erg/sq cm/sec and may reach 5 times this value.

A numerical simulation of the multiple corotating interaction region (CIR) evolutions from one spacecraft to its sister spacecraft is shown to have confirmed the suggestion by Smith et al (1978) that Jupiter's magnetosphere was compressed by interplanetary CIRs during three out of four of the observed events. The MHD simulation presented suggests that the Jupiter magnetosphere reacts to solar wind rarefactions by expanding. A pair of previously unexplained magnetopause crossings of the Pioneer 11 outbound pass may be due to a delayed reexpansion of the Jupiter magnetosphere from a compression that occurred during the inbound pass.",2013-08-11,1981-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The data, which plan the invariant latitude range 56 deg to 75 deg, show the presence of strong heating throughout the auroral regions. Of special interest are brief interludes of intense heating (greater than 50 mW/sq m) that are observed at nearly all local times and latitudes in response to magnetospheric disturbances. Further, there seem to be particular regions of the auroral oval where Joule heating seems to be continually enhanced above the broad background. The results of six 24-hour experiments are presented to illustrate summer and winter conditions. A shorter eight hour experiment is also given to show the characteristics of cleft heating, insofar as they are visible to the Chatanika radar.",2013-08-11,1981-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Accurately estimating limb radiance by splicing together interpolated information from the emissivity curves requires no temperature or pressure weighting, and only two interpolations per layer path. The emissivity growth approximation (EGA) technique is applied in a simulated inversion study to the inference of O3, H2O, NO2 and HNO3, and it is found to have comparable accuracies to more sophisticated many-degree band models. The EGA technique is also found to be two orders of magnitude faster, while requiring one second per inversion for one constituent at one-km resolution, allowing a completely nonlinear relaxation time inversion to be done at linear speeds. The technique is also expected to work well for nadir calculations, and prove adequate for estimating occultation radiances.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Temperature and density are estimated, and chi-square tests are used to place confidence limits on the result. The logarithmic oxygen abundance is found to be 9.50, and the abundance of other heavy elements are also enhanced, such as N = 8.87, S = 7.4, and Ar = 7.4. Helium, sulfur, and argon abundances are affected by uncertainties in the corrections for unobserved ions, which remains consistent with the exceptionally low electron temperature of less than 5600 K. Results agree with the usual models of planetary nebula formation; and therefore, if H1-55 is formed like most planetary nebulae, there must be some very metal-rich stars in the galactic bulge.",2013-08-11,1981-07-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

Close-coupling calculations are used for the Be sequence, assuming a 10 level ion; for B sequence ions mainly distorted wave calculations in an 11 level ion are used, but close-coupling cross sections are used for some ions; for C and Mg sequence ions, distorted wave calculations are used with 15 and 10 level ions, respectively, and close-coupling results are used for Li-like ions with two levels. Results are presented and include the following: the coronal hole spectrum shows a smaller slope in the emission measure distribution, consistent with the expected outflow effects. It is concluded that the simple constant pressure models of static coronal loops of constant cross section are basically able to match the observed emission measure distribution of the average quiet sun between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 K. However, the cell center and network distributions are respectively steeper and shallower than predicted by the detailed cooling curve.",2013-08-11,1981-07-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

III - Comparison of static models with X-ray, EUV, and radio observations","Numerical models of static coronal loops in energy balance are compared with high spatial resolution observations of extreme ultraviolet lines, broad-band X-ray emission, and interferometric observations at 2.8 cm of a solar active region. Difficulties of using scaling laws to test static models of coronal loops are reviewed. The theoretical model used for the comparison is summarized; the detailed X-ray, EUV, and microwave observations of the selected active region are presented; and the comparison of the model with the observations is performed. It is shown that simple static models with conductive flux vanishing at the loop base reproduce satisfactorily the observed properties in the upper portion of loop structures from compact, high-pressure loops in the core of the region to more extended, fainter loops and to large-scale loops interconnecting different active regions. Effects of changing loop parameters are investigated, and it is argued, that in contrast to the present approach, scaling laws cannot be used to discriminate between different static energy balance models. Some discrepancy is found between model predictions and observations for the lower sections of loop structures. Possible causes of the discrepancy are discussed.",2013-08-11,1981-07-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

The spectrum of this object flattens at wavelengths longer than 2.2 microns. Upper limits are also given for the 10-micron emission from 2255+14, 0026+34, and 0406+121. Photometry between 1.25 and 2.2 microns confirms the variability of 1413+135, 2255+41, and 0406+121. Five percent resolution spectra of 1413+135 and 0406+121 between 1.5 and 2.4 microns show no emission or absorption lines. The spectral data rule out the possibility that 1413+135 is a quasar with normal line strengths and a redshift less than 1.3 and greater than 4. The lack of features of the 1.5-2.4-micron spectra, the rapid variability, and the overall shape of the radio, infrared, and X-ray energy distributions are consistent with a BL Lac nature for these objects.",2013-08-11,1981-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The measurements were made during a period of solar activity minimum (1976-1977) and show a strong solar latitude effect. The data were analyzed with both a model independent, direct numerical inversion technique and with model fitting, yielding essentially the same results. It is shown that the solar wind density can be represented by two power laws near the solar equator proportional to r exp -2.7 and r exp -2.04.

These stars show no evidence for radial velocity variations in excess of plus or minus 3 to plus or minus 20 km/s, arguing against duplicity.

The feature is found to be symmetric with no fine structure with an equivalent-width upper unit paralleling that of H2. The feature is as narrow as 0.4 A, although much broader in other stars due to cloud blending in the line of sight, and is absent in all observed stars with E(B-V) less than 0.1, and upper limits more than an order of magnitude below values extrapolated from more reddened stars. Upper limits are determined by multiplying the square root of the number of channels in which the line may lie, and another narrow feature, although highly asymmetric, is observed at 6194.6 A.

A newly observed emission feature appears in the spectrum of IRC +10216 and several other carbon stars at wavelengths greater than 24 microns. The feature is interpreted as resulting from a solid-state resonance in the dust grains which have condensed around these stars. A similar feature appears in the spectra of IC 418 and NGC 6572, implying that the same type of dust is present.

It is found that the color temperature of the coherent oscillation detected in these two wavelength bands is between 28,000 and 73,000 K. The color temperature of the nonoscillating luminosity is much lower. The arrival times of photons in these two bands have also been correlated, and it is found that the time interval between the long-wavelength coherent signal and the ultraviolet coherent signal is 0.26 + or - 0.5 sec. These results suggest that it is the surface of the white dwarf or the hot inner portion of the accretion disk which is emitting the coherent signal. The oscillations become detectably incoherent at the approach to minimum light after the outburst, as would be expected if the oscillating medium becomes more dissipative as it cools, or if there were increased modulation by clouds of obscuring material.",2013-08-11,1981-08-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

A class of theoretical models is presented, expressed in closed analytic forms, thus facilitating the direct illustration of the nonlinear physical properties. The model couples the equilibrium between magnetic field, plasma pressure, and weight on the one hand, with the balance between a rho-squared T radiative loss, a rho wave heating (where rho equals plasma density, and T equals plasma temperature), and thermal conduction channeled along magnetic field lines on the other. The steady solutions are divided into three classes, and are characterized by the total wave heating in the prominence sheet which is greater than, equal to, or less than the total radiative loss. The compaction of the plasma along the field lines, under its own weight, and the energy transport effects determine which of the three basic behaviors obtains in a particular situation.

The plates have a through-thickness steady-state temperature distribution, and the effects are considered by using Maxwell's law to modify the power creep law. Equations are derived for creep exponents of 3 and 5, using the sandwich plate element to predict creep buckling of plates. Predictions of creep buckling with a temperature variation between the inner and outer plate surfaces are found to be somewhat dependent on the creep buckling relationship assumed. When significant scatter justifies a variation in the creep constants up to an order of magnitude, discrepancies in predictions using the two exponents are reasonable, and for one engineering material, the predictions have the same degree of agreement with experimental data as have the respective creep laws.",2013-08-11,1981-04-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Properties of the environment are discussed which exert an influence on the adhesion, friction, wear, and lubrication of materials in contact. The effect of the environment on lubricants and their properties is considered with respect to the interaction of lubricants with material surfaces in contact; the effect on the ability of lubricants to provide protective surface films is also considered.

Key elements of the simulation were the representation of a control system jam, the pilot's breaking of a shear pin in the jammed control, and the resultant BUCS engagement. To minimize the excursions in aircraft motion which could result from the pilot's control inputs after shear pin breakage, the BUCS control function is blended in gradually. The experiment's results indicate that optimum time to full control authority after shear pin breakage is three seconds in all axes for certain critical tasks. Special pilot training in the recovery from a control system jam may be necessary to minimize unacceptably large aircraft transients in the off-axis.",2013-08-11,1981-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Other investigations conducted with similar objectives have not been satisfactory in connection with a use of procedures providing an unrealistic distribution of initial errors. In the current study, care has been taken to duplicate the actual distribution of information in the conventional observing system, thus shifting the emphasis from accuracy of the data to the data coverage. It is pointed out that this is an important consideration in assessing satellite observing systems since experience with sounder data has shown that improvements in forecasts due to satellite-derived information is due less to a general error reduction than to the ability to fill data-sparse regions.

The present paper presents an investigation of the effect of zoning produced during solidification on the use of the Wood method. Cooling rate curves were obtained in a computer simulation based on a model of kamacite formation on the outer edge of a taenite sphere of uniform initial composition, followed by the inward radial progression of the kamacite-taenite interface. When a concentration gradient produced by solidification is present in the initial conditions, deviations from the cooling rate curves for uniform 10% Ni are obtained only at cooling rates greater than 1000 K/million years, which would result in an overestimation of the cooling rates based on observed Ni gradients in grains of radius greater than 20 microns.",2013-08-11,1981-09-10,,CDMS,OTHER,

Because of the presence of numerous gamma-ray lines in the detector background spectra and because of the relatively long exposure time of the HEAO 3 satellite to cosmic-ray and trapped protons, it has been possible to measure both the energy and time dependence of radiation damage. After 100 d in orbit, each of the four detectors has been exposed to approximately 3 x 10 to the 7th protons/sq cm, and the average energy resolution at 1460 keV had degraded from 3.2 keV fwhm to 8.6 keV fwhm.

Metabolic rates were measured according to oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production for individual male and female Swiss-Webster mice, Syrian hamsters, Simonsen albino rats, Hartley guinea pigs and New Zealand white rabbits, which range in mass from 0.05 to 5 kg mature body size, at ages of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months. The metabolic intensity, defined as the heat produced per hour per kg body mass, is found to decrease dramatically with age until the animals are 6 to 8 months old, with little or no sex difference. When plotted on a logarithmic graph, the relation of metabolic rate to total body mass is found to obey a power law of index 0.676, which differs significantly from the classical value of 0.75. When the values for the mice are removed, however, an index of 0.749 is obtained.

The main difficulty is related to the determination of the thermal stress field because of its unusual character and its dependence upon boundary conditions at points far from the region of thermal activity. Examination of a number of examples suggests that the best visualization of the thermal stresses and any associated fracture can be made by considering the problem to be the combination of thermal and isothermal problems or by considering that the prime effect of the temperature is in the generation of thermal strains and that the thermal stresses are simply the result of the region trying to accommodate these strains.",2013-08-11,1980-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

These expressions are then used to model the jet flow field and to analyze the high subsonic and supersonic jet noise generation. It is shown that noise will be generated directly if the helical mode convects or rotates. Reducing this noise by stabilizing the mode is difficult, since the self-induced velocities of the mode itself cause it to convect and rotate; the use of noncircular nozzles is suggested to eliminate the symmetry of the boundary condition. The helical mode can also generate noise indirectly by inducing time-dependent Coriolis accelerations on small-scale turbulence propagating in its induced velocity field. This suggests that any upstream turbulence generation has an enhanced potential for noise propagation when propagating in the presence of the helical mode.",2013-08-11,1981-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The analysis uses a method of matched asymptotic expansions, yielding a set of inner equations of motion and shock conditions valid in the near-sonic throat region.

Results for both heated and unheated jets with and without flight simulation are presented for a range of excitation frequencies and levels, as well as for the zero order and first order spinning modes. It is argued that although the phase-locked large-scale turbulence structure is at the root of the noise amplification process, the actual noise generation mechanism lies in the small-scale turbulence. Results show that (1) the phase velocity of the excited large scale instability waves is subsonic relative to the ambient fluid and (2) broadband jet noise is almost uniform at all frequencies. Moreover, when the large-scale and small-scale structures are plotted against forward velocity (for a given upstream excitation level of 141 dB), the change in large-scale turbulence is negligible with forward velocity, whereas the small-scale turbulence decreases for both excited and unexcited jets. Also, the corresponding difference in far-field noise does not appear to change significantly, indicating that the changes in small-scale turbulence are responsible for jet noise amplification.",2013-08-11,1981-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Absorption cross sections were measured at wavelengths between 185 and 300 nm in a double-beam spectrometer at temperatures of 295 and 225 K. The results are found to be in good agreement with previous reports in the short wavelength region, but significantly lower than the value of 2 x 10 to the 22nd sq cm/molecule proposed by Rudolf and Inn (1981) between 280 and 300 nm, which may be attributed to trace contaminants or dimerization. A marked temperature effect is noted at wavelengths greater than 240 nm and below 190 nm. As no evidence of absorption at wavelengths greater than 270 nm was found, estimates of the solar photodissociation rate of tropospheric OCS based on the present cross sections yield a value of about 2 x 10 to the -9th/sec, corresponding to a tropospheric lifetime of about 20 years.

The polar and equatorial electrostatic tension for axis ratios between 0.01 and 1000 are calculated, and the polar pressure is found to be larger than the equatorial pressure for prolate spheroids. The electrostatic polar pressure profile along the polar axis for prolate spheroids is calculated, and the pressure is found to increase monotonically from a minimum at the center to a maxima at the ends. This indicates that as a prolate spheroid of uniform tensile strength is charged up, it will continue to chip off at the ends when the electrostatic pressure there exceeds the uniform tensile strength of the grain.

ICAP differs from conventional clustering algorithms by allowing the analyst to optimize the cluster configuration by inspection, rather than by manipulating process parameters. Control of the clustering process alternates between the algorithm, which creates new centroids and forms clusters, and the analyst, who can evaluate and elect to modify the cluster structure. Clusters can be deleted, or lumped together pairwise, or new centroids can be added. A summary of the cluster statistics can be requested to facilitate cluster manipulation. The principal advantage of this approach is that it allows prior information (when available) to be used directly in the analysis, since the analyst interacts with ICAP in a straightforward manner, using basic terms with which he is more likely to be familiar. Results from testing ICAP showed that an informed use of ICAP can improve classification, as compared to an existing cluster analysis procedure.",2013-08-11,1981-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

This modulation was studied for each of the five resolvable components of the hyperfine structure separately. The fluorescence from the even isotopes was determined to be almost completely modulated while the fluorescence from the odd isotopes was only partially modulated. The frequency of modulation of the fluorescence from the mercury-202 isotope was observed as a function of the applied magnetic field and a value for the Lande factor of 1.46 + or - 0.03 was obtained.

The vents were investigated aerodynamically to obtain vent-tube pressures and pressure distributions on the ramp surface as functions of tunnel-air velocity and angle of attack. Icing investigations were made to determine the vent-tube pressure losses for several icing conditions at tunnel-air velocities ranging from 220 to 440 feet per second. In general, under nonicing conditions, the configurations with diverging ramp walls maintained, vent-tube pressures greater than the required marginal value of 2 inches of water positive pressure differential between the fuel cell and the compartment containing the fuel cell for a range of angles of attack from 0 to 14deg at a tunnel-air velocity of approximately 240 feet per second. A configuration haying divergIng ramp sldewalls, a 7deg ramp angle; and vent tubes manifold,ed to a common plenum chamber opening through a slot In the ramp floor gave the greatest vent-tube pressures for all the configurations investigated. The use of the plenum chamber resulted in uniform pressures in all vent tubes. In a cloud-icing condition, roughness caused by ice formations on the airfoil surface ahead of the vent ramp, rather than icing of the vent configuration, caused a rapid loss in vent-tube pressures during the first few minutes of an icing period. Only the configuration having diverging ramp sidewalls, a 7 ramp angle, and a common plenum chamber maintained the required vent-tube pressures throughout a 60-minute icing period, although the ice formations on this configuration were more severe than those observed for the other configurations. No complete closure of vent-tube openings occurred for the configurations investigated. A simulated freezing-rain condition caused a greater and more rapid vent-tube pressure loss than was observed for a cloud-icing condition.",2013-08-11,1949-03-01,/api/citations/19810068591/downloads/19810068591.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Drag measurements indicated, that without icing, the de-icer installation increased the section drag to approximately 140 percent of that of the bare airfoil; with the tubes inflated, this value increased to a maximum of approximately 620 percent.

Agreement in the order of magnitude of eff 1- ciency losses to be expected is obtained between measured and analytical results. The results indicate that, in general, efficiency losses can be expected to be less than 10 percent; whereas maximum losses, which will be encountered only rarely, may be as high as 15 or 20 percent.

The effects of ice accretions on airfoil-section characteristics at subcritical speeds and their influence on drag-divergence Mach number are examined, and. the attendant maximum efficiency losses are computed.

For normal nonicing operation, the inertia-separation- inlet total-pressure losses were comparable to a direct-ram installation. The pressure losses and the circumferential uniformity of the mass flow in all the inlets were relatively independent of angle of attack.

The data were obtained at an airspeed of 157 knots and are correlated by dimensionless impingement parameters. In general, the experimental data show that the local and total impingement rates and impingement limits of bodies of revolution are primarily functions of the modified inertia parameters, the body shape, and fineness ratio. Both the local impingement rate and impingement limits depend upon the angle of attack. Rotation of the bodies had a negligible effect on the impingement characteristics except for an averaging effect at angle of attack. For comparable diameters the bluffer bodies had the largest total impingement efficiency, but the finer and sharper bodies had the largest values of maximum local impingement efficiency and, in most cases, the largest limits of impingement. In most cases, the impingement characteristics were less than those calculated from theoretical trajectories; in general, however, fairly good agreement was obtained between the experimental and theoretical impingement characteristics.",2013-08-11,1957-12-01,/api/citations/19810068702/downloads/19810068702.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19810068704,FLUID MECHANICS AND HEAT TRANSFER,Use of Truncated Flapped Airfoils for Impingement and Icing Tests of Full-Scale Leading-Edge Sections,"In an effort to increase the operational range of existing small icing tunnels, the use of truncated airfoil sections has been suggested. With truncated airfoils, large-scale or even full-scale wing-icing-protection systems could be evaluated. Therefore, experimental studies were conducted in the NACA Lewis laboratory icing 'tunnel with an NACA 651-212 airfoil section to determine the effect of truncating the airfoil chord on velocity distribution and impingement characteristics. A 6-foot-chord airfoil was cut successively at the 50- and 30-percent-chord stations to produce the truncated airfoil sections, which were equipped with trailing-edge flaps that were used to alter the flow field about the truncated sections. The study was conducted at geometric angles of attack of 00 and 40, an airspeed of about 156 knots, and volume-median droplet sizes of 11.5 and 18.6 microns. A dye-tracer technique was used in the impingement studies. With the trailing-edge flap on the truncated airfoil deflected so that the local velocity distribution in the impingement region was substantially the same as that for the full-chord airfoil, the local impingement rates and the limits of impingement for the truncated and full-chord airfoils were the same. In general, truncating the airfoils with flaps undeflected resulted in a subs'tantially altered velocity distribution and local impingement rates compared with those of the full-chord airfoil. The use of flapped truncated airfoils may permit impingement and icing studies to be conducted with full-scale leading-edge sections, ranging in size from tip to root sections.",2013-08-11,1956-07-24,/api/citations/19810068704/downloads/19810068704.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The results are presented in the form of heat-transfer coefficients and the correlation of Nusselt and Reynolds numbers. Both a uniform surface temperature and a uniform input heater density distribution were used. The experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions for uniform surface temperature distribution. Complete agreement was not obtained with uniform input heat density in the laminar-flow region because of conduction effects. No significant effects of rotation were obtained over the range of airstream and rotational speeds investigated. Operation at angle of attack had only minor effects on the local heat transfer. Transition from laminar to turbulent heat transfer occurred over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The location of transition depended primarily on surface roughness and pressure and temperature gradients. Limited transient heating data indicate that the variation of surface temperature with time followed closely an exponential relation.",2013-08-11,1956-11-01,/api/citations/19810068705/downloads/19810068705.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The range of test conditions included free-stream velocities up to 400 feet per second, rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm, and. angles of attack of 0 deg and 6 deg. Both a uniform surface temperature and a uniform heater input power density were used. The Nusselt-Reynolds number relations provided good correlation of the heat-transfer data for the complete operating range at 0 deg angle of attack with and without spinner rotation, and for 6deg angle of attack with rotation. Rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm had no apparent effect on the heat-transfer characteristics of the spinner. The results obtained at 6 deg angle of attack with rotation were essentially the same as those obtained at 0 deg angle of attack without rotation. The experimental heat-transfer characteristics in the turbulent flow region were consistently in closer agreement with the results predicted for a two-dimensional body than with those predicted. for a cone. For stationary operation at 60 angle of attack, the measured heat-transfer coefficients in the turbulent flow region were from 6 to 13 percent greater on the lower surface (windward. side) than on the upper surface (sheltered side) for corresponding surface locations. The spinner-nose geometry appeared to cause early boundary-layer transition. Transition was initiated at a fairly constant Reynolds number (based on surface distance from nose) of 8.0 x 10(exp 4). Transition was completed at Reynolds numbers less than 5.0 x 10(exp 5) for all conditions investigated.",2013-08-11,1957-10-01,/api/citations/19810068706/downloads/19810068706.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The results indicate that rain deflection by jet blast appears feasible for flight speeds comparable with landing and take-off speeds of interceptor-type jet aircraft; however, attainment of good visibility through the mist generated by raindrop breakup presents a problem. For the simulated windshield and the lower windshield angles used in the investigation, air-flow rates of the order of 3.3 pounds per minute of unheated air per inch of windshield span were required for adequate rain deflection at a free-stream velocity of 135 miles per hour. A method has been devised whereby it is possible to produce large-diameter water drops (1000 to 1500 p.) in a moving air stream, without breakup, at speeds in excess of 175 miles per hour.",2013-08-11,1955-07-25,/api/citations/19810068716/downloads/19810068716.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The studies included both uniform heating densities over the spinner and uniform surface temperatures.. In general, the results showed that rotation will increase the convective heat transfer from a spinner, especially in the turbulent-flow regions. Rotation of the spinner at 1200 rpm and at a free-stream velocity of 275 miles per hour increased the Nusselt number parameter in the turbulent-flow region by 32 percent over that obtained with a stationary spinner; whereas in the nose region, where the flow was laminar, an increase of only 18 percent was observed. Transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurred over a large range of Reynolds numbers primarily because of surface roughness of the spinner.

Determinations of liquid water content were found to agree within the limits of the probable error, but the two instruments designed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics indicated larger drop sizes than did the Observatory's instrument, apparently because of spurious ice catch on the rather rough surface of the larger cylinders. Comparisons of drop-size distribution were largely indeterminate., In a critique of the method, the probable error of determination of liquid water content was found to be +/-8 percent; of drop size, +/-6 percent; and of drop-size distribution, about +/-0.7 unit of the modulus of distribution. Of the systematic errors, run-off of unfrozen water is most important, blow-off and erosion seldom being hampering. Revision of collection-efficiency computations for cylinders in clouds with distributed drop sizes was found necessary and also revision of one of the correction-factor graphs heretofore used. The assumption of constant ice density in deriving cylinder size was found to be permissible for cylinders 1 inch or more in diameter.",2013-08-11,1952-06-01,/api/citations/19810068732/downloads/19810068732.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In this aeroscope the cloud droplets are continuously captured in a stream of oil, which Is then photographed by a photomicrographic camera. The droplet size and size distribution can be determined directly from the photographs. With the droplet size distribution known, the liquid-water content of the cloud can be computed from the geometry of the aeroscope, the airspeed, and the oil-flow rate. The aeroscope has the following features: Data are obtained semi-automatically, and permanent data are taken in the form of photographs. A single picture usually contains a sufficient number of droplets to establish the droplet size distribution. Cloud droplets are continuously captured in the stream of oil, but pictures are taken at Intervals. The aeroscope can be operated in icing and non-icing conditions. Because of mixing of oil in the instrument, the droplet-distribution patterns and liquid-water content values from a single picture are exponentially weighted average values over a path length of about 3/4 mile at 150 miles per hour. The liquid-water contents, volume-median diameters, and distribution patterns obtained on test flights and in the Lewis icing tunnel are similar to previously published data.",2013-08-11,1956-01-01,/api/citations/19810068735/downloads/19810068735.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Additional information obtained during descent through a part of the cloud system indicated liquid-water contents that significantly exceeded theoretical values, especially near the middle of the cloud layer.. The growth of cloud droplets to sizes that resulted in sedimentation from the upper portions of the cloud is considered to be a possible cause of the high water contents near the center of the cloud layer. Flight measurements of the vertical temperature distribution in the cloud layer indicated a rate of change of temperature with altitude exceeding that of the moist adiabatic lapse rate.

The weather missions studied were flown at fixed flight levels of 500 millibars (18,000 ft) and 700 millibars (10,000 ft) over wide areas of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans. This report is presented as part of a program conducted by the NACA to obtain extensive icing statistics relevant to aircraft design and operation. The thousands of in-flight observations recorded over a 2- to 4-year period provide reliable statistics on icing encounters for the specific areas, altitudes, and seasons included in the data. The relative frequencies of icing occurrence are presented, together with the estimated icing probabilities and the relation of these probabilities to the frequencies of flight in clouds and cloud temperatures. The results show that aircraft operators can expect icing probabilities to vary widely throughout the year from near zero in the cold Arctic areas in winter up to 7 percent in areas where greater cloudiness and warmer temperatures prevail. The data also reveal a general tendency of colder cloud temperatures to reduce the probability of icing in equally cloudy conditions.",2013-08-11,1957-05-01,/api/citations/19810068859/downloads/19810068859.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19810068865,METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Maximum Evaporation Rates of Water Droplets Approaching Obstacles in the Atmosphere Under Icing Conditions,"When a closed body or a duct envelope moves through the atmosphere, air pressure and temperature rises occur ahead of the body or, under ram conditions, within the duct. If cloud water droplets are encountered, droplet evaporation will result because of the air-temperature rise and the relative velocity between the droplet and stagnating air. It is shown that the solution of the steady-state psychrometric equation provides evaporation rates which are the maximum possible when droplets are entrained in air moving along stagnation lines under such conditions. Calculations are made for a wide variety of water droplet diameters, ambient conditions, and flight Mach numbers. Droplet diameter, body size, and Mach number effects are found to predominate, whereas wide variation in ambient conditions are of relatively small significance in the determination of evaporation rates. The results are essentially exact for the case of movement of droplets having diameters smaller than about 30 microns along relatively long ducts (length at least several feet) or toward large obstacles (wings), since disequilibrium effects are then of little significance. Mass losses in the case of movement within ducts will often be significant fractions (one-fifth to one-half) of original droplet masses, while very small droplets within ducts will often disappear even though the entraining air is not fully stagnated. Wing-approach evaporation losses will usually be of the order of several percent of original droplet masses. Two numerical examples are given of the determination of local evaporation rates and total mass losses in cases involving cloud droplets approaching circular cylinders along stagnation lines. The cylinders chosen were of 3.95-inch (10.0+ cm) diameter and 39.5-inch 100+ cm) diameter. The smaller is representative of icing-rate measurement cylinders, while with the larger will be associated an air-flow field similar to that ahead of an airfoil having a leading-edge radius comparable with that of the cylinder. It is found that the losses are less than 5 percent. It is concluded that such losses are, in general, very small (less than 1 percent) in the case of smaller obstacles (of icing-rate measurement- cylinder size); the motional dynamics are such, however, that exceptions will occur by reason of failure of very small droplets (moving along stagnation lines) to impinge upon obstacle surfaces. In such cases, the droplets will evaporate completely.",2013-08-11,1953-10-01,/api/citations/19810068865/downloads/19810068865.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The critical crossflow Reynolds number is shown to be a function of a boundary layer shape factor. Amplification rates for crossflow disturbances are shown to be proportional to the maximum crossflow velocity.

The growth of the momentum thickness, the mean velocity profile, the turbulence kinetic energy, the Reynolds stresses, the anisotropy tensor, and particle track pictures of computations are all examined in an effort to better understand the physics of these regimes. The amplitude, spectrum shape, and random phases of the initial disturbance field were varied. A scheme of generating discrete orthogonal function expansions on some nonuniform grids was developed. All cases address the early or near field of the mixing layer. The most significant result shows that the secondary instability of the mixing layer is produced by spanwise variations in the straining field of the primary vortex structures.",2013-09-04,1981-08-01,/api/citations/19820003520/downloads/19820003520.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The full compressible Navier-Stokes equations were used in a simulation on the ILLIAC IV computer with a 64,000 mesh. The flow fields generated by the code are used as an experimental data base, to examine the behavior of the Reynols stresses in this simple, compressible flow. The variation of the structure of the stresses and their dynamic equations as the character of the flow changed is emphasized. The structure of the tress tensor is more heavily dependent on the shear number and less on the fluctuating Mach number. The pressure-strain correlation tensor in the dynamic uations is directly calculated in this simulation. These correlations are decomposed into several parts, as contrasted with the traditional incompressible decomposition into two parts. The performance of existing models for the conventional terms is examined, and a model is proposed for the 'mean fluctuating' part.",2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19820003523/downloads/19820003523.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19820003640,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,An evaluation of the spatial resolution of soil moisture information,"Rainfall-amount patterns in the central regions of the U.S. were assessed. The spatial scales of surface features and their corresponding microwave responses in the mid western U.S. were investigated. The usefulness for U.S. government agencies of soil moisture information at scales of 10 km and 1 km. was ascertained. From an investigation of 494 storms, it was found that the rainfall resulting from the passage of most types of storms produces patterns which can be resolved on a 10 km scale. The land features causing the greatest problem in the sensing of soil moisture over large agricultural areas with a radiometer are bodies of water. Over the mid-western portions of the U.S., water occupies less than 2% of the total area, the consequently, the water bodies will not have a significant impact on the mapping of soil moisture. Over most of the areas, measurements at a 10-km resolution would adequately define the distribution of soil moisture. Crop yield models and hydrological models would give improved results if soil moisture information at scales of 10 km was available.",2013-09-04,1981-03-01,/api/citations/19820003640/downloads/19820003640.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The results included the maximum mirror surface temperature during the orbit as well as the worst-case loss of optical performance due to thermally-induced mirror distortions.

The studies not only provided extensive data for the baseline arrangement, but also evaluated the effects of key aircraft configuration variables (inlet location, canopy-dorsal integration, wing leading-edge extension planform area, and variable incidence canards) on top inlet performance. In order to set these data in the context of practical aircraft systems top inlet performance is compared with that of more conventional inlet/airframe integrations. The results of these evaluations show that, for the top inlet configuration tested, relatively good inlet performance and compatibility characteristics are maintained during subsonic and transonic maneuver. However, at supersonic speeds, flow expansion over the forebody and wings causes an increase in local inlet Mach number subsequently reduces inlet performance levels. These characteristics infer that although top inlets many not pose a viable design option for aircraft requiring a high degree of supersonic maneuverability, they have distinct promise for vehicles with subsonic and transonic maneuver capabilities.",2013-08-10,1981-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The flow in the inviscid zone, which surrounds most of the aircraft, is calculated using an existing potential flow code. The viscous flow zone, which encompasses the jet plume, is modeled using a parabolized Navier-Stokes code. The procedure features the coupling of the zonal solutions such that sufficient information is transferred between the zones to preserve the effects of the interactions.

The controller inputs were sufficient to exceed the priority rate limit set in the pitch axis. A nonlinear analytical study was conducted to investigate the combined effects of pilot input, rate limiting, and time delays. The frequency response of the total system is presented parametrically as a function of the three variables.

19820005794,MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT,The cognitive demands of second order manual control:  Applications of the event related brain potential,"Three experiments are described in which tracking difficulty is varied in the presence of a covert tone discrimination task. Event related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by the tones are employed as an index of the resource demands of tracking. The ERP measure reflected the control order variation, and this variable was thereby assumed to compete for perceptual/central processing resources. A fine-grained analysis of the results suggested that the primary demands of second order tracking involve the central processing operations of maintaining a more complex internal model of the dynamic system, rather than the perceptual demands of higher derivative perception. Experiment 3 varied tracking bandwidth in random input tracking, and the ERP was unaffected. Bandwidth was then inferred to compete for response-related processing resources that are independent of the ERP.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005794/downloads/19820005794.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The first experiment involved five different sum of sine tracking tasks which humans tracked both in a static condition and under a 5 Gz acceleration stress condition. The second experiment involved similar environmental stress conditions but in this case the tasks were constructed from deterministic functions with specially designed velocity and acceleration profiles. Phase Plane performance analysis was conducted to study potential measures of workload or tracking difficulty.,2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005795/downloads/19820005795.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The difficulty is compounded by the facts that wave generated forces are extremely high, depth and pitch signals are very noisy and submarine speed is such that overall dynamics are slow. A mathematical simulation of the depthkeeping team based on the optimal control models is described. A solution of the optimal team control problem with an output control restriction (limited display to each controller) is presented.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005816/downloads/19820005816.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The impact of such a system is far reaching in terms of improved safety, pilot and controller workload, and aircraft fuel efficiency. One direct payoff is the ability to distribute the ATC workload to the pilot in such tasks as merging and spacing. The CDTI application of spacing approach aircraft in the terminal area is addressed. In-trail-following/CDTI experiments were performed using realistic cockpit simulators and profile descent approach scenarios. Based on collected experimental simulator data, pilot models were developed which include state estimation, decision making and flight control aspects. These models were coupled with models of aircraft and CDTI equipment to study the dynamic phenomena and stability of strings of aircraft along various approach patterns.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005817/downloads/19820005817.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792
19820005830,MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT,The influence of ship motion of manual control skills,"The effects of ship motion on a range of typical manual control skills were examined on the Warren Spring ship motion simulator driven in heave, pitch, and roll by signals taken from the frigate HMS Avenger at 13 m/s (25 knots) into a force 4 wind. The motion produced a vertical r.m.s. acceleration of 0.024g, mostly between 0.1 and 0.3 Hz, with comparatively little pitch or roll. A task involving unsupported arm movements was seriously affected by the motion; a pursuit tracking task showed a reliable decrement although it was still performed reasonably well (pressure and free moving tracking controls were affected equally by the motion); a digit keying task requiring ballistic hand movements was unaffected. There was no evidence that these effects were caused by sea sickness. The differing response to motion of the different tasks, from virtual destruction to no effect, suggests that a major benefit could come from an attempt to design the man/control interface onboard ship around motion resistant tasks.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005830/downloads/19820005830.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The preliminary control experiments were aimed at the investigation of the human operators' ability to command and control forces in different directions by varying the information conditions and the values of the feedforward and feedback command gains in the bilateral control loop. The main conclusions are: (1) a quantified graphic display of force-torque information can considerably enhance the operator's ability to perform a quantitatively sharp force-torque control, and (2) there seems to be a task dependent optimal combination of the feedforward and feedback command gain values which provide a dynamically smooth and stable bilateral control performance.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005834/downloads/19820005834.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

Substantial improvement in the accuracy of surface fire against attacking aircraft has been realized through the design of a director-type weapon control system. This system concept frees the gunner to exercise a supervisory/monitoring role while the computer takes over continuous target tracking. This change capitalizes on a key consideration of human factors engineering while increasing system accuracy. The advanced system design, which uses distributed microprocessor control, is discussed at the block diagram level and is contrasted with the previous implementation.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005842/downloads/19820005842.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The RPN calculator showed markedly superior resistance to interruption effects compared to the AN calculator although no significant differences were found when the users were not interrupted. Causes and possible remedies for interruption effects are speculated. It is proposed that because interruption is such a common occurrence, it be incorporated into comparative evaluation tests of different logic system and control/display system and that interruption resistance be adopted as a specific design criteria for such design.",2013-08-10,1981-10-15,/api/citations/19820005848/downloads/19820005848.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820005792

The hardware and software for controlling the analog to digital converter and conversion rate were completed, and the system is operational. A duty cycle control circit was implemented so that on the sixteenth conversion a relay shuts off the vibration exciter used to generate the sound wave. Thus the starting point of each decay curve is exactly known. This information is necessary for evaluating the g digital decay information.

Light scattering techniques can be applied to mixtures of particles (nephelometers) and to single particles as well. Measuring particle mixtures simplify detection because of the higher intensity level, however, information concerning the individual particle is lost. To provide well defined conditions over the whole rendezvous period, i.e., constant illumination beam and unchangeable scattering angle, the use of an artificial light source (instead of the sun) and a scattering volume located within the S/C is desirable. Considering this and the relatively low particle densities to be expected, the measurement of particle mixtures must be excluded.",2013-08-10,1981-10-01,/api/citations/19820006126/downloads/19820006126.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The investigation generated and compared three path update algorithms designed to provide smooth transition for an aircraft guidance system from DME, VORTAC, and barometric navaids to the more precise MLS by modifying the desired 3-D flight path. The first, called the Zero Cross Track, eliminates the discontinuity in cross track and altitude error by designating the first valid MLS aircraft position as the desired first waypoint, while retaining all subsequent waypoints. The discontinuity in track angle is left unaltered. The second, called the Tangent Path also eliminates the discontinuity in cross track and altitude and choose a new desired heading to be tangent to the next oncoming circular arc turn. The third, called the Continued Track eliminates the discontinuity in cross track, altitude and track angle by accepting the current MLS position and track angle as the desired ones and recomputes the location of the next waypoint. A method is presented for providing a waypoint guidance path reconstruction which treats turns of less than, and greater than, 180 degrees in a uniform manner to construct the desired path.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820008187/downloads/19820008187.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A preliminary anaysis of the aircraft-vessel landing guidance requirements was conducted. The various subelements and constraints of the flight system are described including the landing scenario, lift fan aircraft, state rate feedback flight control, MLS-based navigation, sea state induced ship motion, and wake turbulence due to wind-over-deck effects. These elements are integrated into a systems model with various guidance concepts. Guidance is described in terms of lateral, vertical, and longitudinal axes steering modes and approach and landing phases divided by a nominal hover (or stationkeeping) point defined with respect to the landing pad. The approach guidance methods are evaluated, and the two better steering concepts are studied by both single pass and Monte Carlo statistical simulation runs. Four different guidance concepts are defined for further analysis for the landing phase of flight.",2013-09-04,1980-07-01,/api/citations/19820008214/downloads/19820008214.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19820008283,"SPACECRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",High-resolution passive microwave imaging of the surface of the Earth,"The physics of passive microwave observations of the Earth and the system requirements for high-resolution imaging within this spectral band are summarized. High resolution is achieved in a straightforward manner by increasing the size of the primary antenna.

All reactors were multielement configurations consisting of ceramic honeycomb catalyzed with palladium on stabilized alumina. Stable operation on residual oil was demonstrated with the baseline configuration at a reactor inlet temperature of about 825 K (1025 F). At low inlet temperature, operation was precluded by apparent plugging of the catalytic reactor with residual oil. Reduced plugging tendency was demonstrated in the backup reactors by increasing the size of the catalyst channels at the reactor inlet, but plugging still occurred at inlet temperature below 725 K (845 F). Operation at the original design inlet temperature of 589 K (600 F) could not be demonstrated. Combustion efficiency above 99.5% was obtained with less than 5% reactor pressure drop.

When a field-aligned current is generated on auroral field lines, the disturbance propagates towards the ionosphere in the form of a kinetic Alfven wave. When the current exceeds a critical value, microscopic turbulence is produced, which modifies the propagation of the Alfven wave. This process is modeled by a nonlinear collision frequency, which increases with the excess of the drift velocity over the critical value. Turbulence leads to absorption and reflection of the Alfven wave, partially decoupling the generator from the ionosphere. The approach to a steady-state is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of the turbulence. The current is self-limiting, since a current in excess of critical causes a diffusion of the magnetic field perturbation and a reduction of current.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820008762/downloads/19820008762.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The kinematic viscosity of the liquid used in the model was 10,000 times higher than the viscosity of perilymph to attain hydrodynamic equality. Two different geometries for the sterocilia pattern were tested. First the force distribution for a W-shaped sterocilia pattern was recorded. This is the sterocilia pattern found in all real ears. It is found that the forces acting on the hairs are very regular and perpendicular to the legs of the W when the flow is directed from the outside of the W. When the flow is reversed, the forces are not reversed, but are much more irregular. This can eventually explain the half wave rectification of the nerve signals. As a second experiment, the force distribution for a V-shaped sterocilia pattern was recorded. Here the forces were irregular both when the flow was directed into the V and when it was directed against the edge of the V.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820008869/downloads/19820008869.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

At helical tip Mach numbers over 1.0, using only the tip shock wave, the model gave a fairly good prediction of the noise for a bladed propeller and for a propeller swept for aerodynamic purposes. However for another propeller, which was highly swept and designed to have noise cancellations from the inboard propeller sections, the shock strength from the tip over predicted the noise. In general the good agreement indicates that shock theory is a viable method for predicting the noise from these supersonic propellers but that the shock strengths from all of the blade sections need to be properly included.",2013-09-04,1981-12-01,/api/citations/19820008935/downloads/19820008935.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The basic procedure for determining this sensitivity was to impose a perturbation in alpha within the convective envelope and then to follow the resulting changes in the solar radius delta R and luminosity delta L for the next 10 to the 6th power yrs. These calculations gave the following results. (1) A perturbation in alpha produces immediate changes in the solar radius and luminosity. Initially delta L and delta alpha are related by delta L/L = 0.30 delta alpha/alpha. (2) The value of the ratio w = delta log R/delta log L is strongly time dependent. Its value just after the perturbation in alpha is 6.5 x 10 to the minus 4th power. (3) The ratio H = (delta log L) d delta log R/dt is much less time dependent and is a more suitable means for relating the changes in the solar radius and luminosity. (4) Both of these ratios imply that for any reasonable change in the solar luminosity the corresponding change in the solar radius is negligible.,2013-08-10,1981-12-01,/api/citations/19820009156/downloads/19820009156.pdf,CDMS,PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820009140

As other phenomena in the same variability class we nominate the liminosity fluctuations of ZZ Ceti stars and the solar 160 m oscillation. We discuss the possibility that analogous physical mechanisms are at work in all these cases, namely instabilities driven in a thin layer. These instabilities should be favorable to grave modes (in angle) and should arise in conditions that may allow more than one kind of instability to occur at once.

If C=O, the generator is called the multiplicative type and those for which C/O are called mixed congruential generators. It is easy to see that congruential generators will repeat a sequence of numbers after a maximum of M values have been generated. The number of numbers that a procedure generates before restarting the sequence is called the length or the period of the generator. Generally, it is desirable to make the period as long as possible. A detailed discussion of congruential generators is given.

The dispersion measure distribution of these pulsars shows significant evidence for a decrease in the electron scale height from a local value greater than the pulsar scale height to a value less than the pulsar scale height at galactocentric radii inside of approximately 7 kpc. An increase in the electron density (to a value around .15/cu cm at 4 to 5 kpc) must accompany such a decrease in scale height.

Such perturbations primarily effect the shallow superadiabatic layer of the convective envelope (at depth of approx. 1000 km below the photosphere). Independent of the details of the perturbation scheme, the resulting change in the solar radius is always very small compared to the change in luminosity. This appears to be true for any physical mechanism of solar variability which operates in the outer layers of the convection zone. Changes of the solar radius have been inferred from historical observations of solar eclipses. Considering the constraints on concurrent luminosity changes, this type of solar variability must be indicative of changes in the solar structure at substantial depths below the superadiabatic layer of the convective envelope.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820010239/downloads/19820010239.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The interaction trajectory of a tip vortex on an acoustic planform is shown to be a very important parameter for the impulsive shape of the noise.

19820010407,LAUNCH VEHICLES AND SPACE VEHICLES,Finite element thermal-structural modeling of orbiting truss structures,"A description of an integrated finite element (FE) thermal-structural approach for accurate and efficient modeling of large space structures is presented. A geometric model with a common discretization for all analyses is employed. It uses improved thermal elements and the results from the thermal analysis directly in the structural analysis without any intervening data processing. The differences between the conventional FE approach as implemented in large programs and an integrated FE approach currently under development are described. Considerations for thermal modeling of truss members is discussed and three thermal truss finite elements are presented. The performance of these elements was evaluated for typical truss members neglecting joint effects. A simple truss with metallic joints and composite members was studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach for realistic truss designs. A study of the effects of aluminum joints on the thermal deformations of a simple, plane truss with composite members showed that joint effects may be significant. Further study is needed to assess the role of joint effects on the deformation of large trusses.",2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010407/downloads/19820010407.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

Linear finite element analysis correlated well with experimental small amplitude vibration data. The buckling and vibration behavior of a pretensional stayed column was studied in detail. The bifurcation buckling load was also predicted accurately. Postbuckling behavior of the column was unusual and results in a post buckling restoring force of only 1/64 the bifurcation buckling load. Interaction between lateral accelerations and compressive load creates isolated stay slackening at loads above 50 percent of the buckling load. Further research will be required to fully understand their impact on the use of pretensioned structures as large space structures.,2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010408/downloads/19820010408.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

In addition, three additional lattice configurations were also constructured along with two beams made of tetrahedrons. The relative frequency variations of the six cantilever truss beams for their first mode were examined. To make the comparison meaningful, the beam length, the number of lattice joints and the total weight were chosen to be identical within 2 percent differences. The frequencies of the four nonperiodic truss beams varied over 60 percent while those of the two beams of tetrahedron lattices only about 13 percent. Such wide frequency variations of the proposed nonperiodic truss beams indicate that the introduction of nonperiodic lattices could be effectively used to improve the controllability of steady state vibration as well as improved wave dispersion characteristics.",2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010410/downloads/19820010410.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

Thus, the learning process is simplified, programming becomes easier, and debugging is more readily accomplished. Programs written in the MultiOptimal Differential Equation Language are machine translated into FORTRAN 4 code which is optimal in several respects. The interactive version of MODEL makes use of interactive system routines so that the user may observe the solution as it is being generated and interact with the program in a manner similar to that associated with analog simulation. The DISCOS-Control version of the MODEL simulation language is used to describe the control system for a plant which is modelled by the DISCOS program. DISCOS plant variables may be referenced in the control system description and all the sensor signals, coupling torques, momentum devices and external loads are automatically linked to the DISCOS plant model.",2013-08-10,1982-03-01,/api/citations/19820010412/downloads/19820010412.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19820010401

Extra costs for a stiff structure are caused by weight, packaging size, etc. Likewise, a more flexible vehicle should result in reduced structural costs but increased costs associated with additional control hardware and data processing required for vibration control of the structure. This tradeoff occurs as the ratio of the control bandwidth required for the mission to the lowest (significant) bending mode of the vehicle.

The cyclophosphazene is obtained by allowing a lithium carborane, e.g., the reaction product of methyl-o-carborane with n-butyllithium in ethyl ether, to react with e.g., hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene at ambient temperatures and in anhydrous conditions. For greater stability in the presence of moisture, the chlorine substituents of the polymer are then replaced by aryloxy or alkoxy groups, such as CF3CH2O. The new substantially inorganic polymers are thermally stable materials which produce a high char yield when exposed to extreme temperatures, and can thus serve to insulate less heat and fire resistant substances.",2013-09-04,1981-09-08,/api/citations/19820010515/downloads/19820010515.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In one embodiment, this is accomplished by computing a correction signal in a correction generating section. In a second embodiment, a second rectification and smoothing filter produces a signal proportional to the absolute value of the controlled input signal.

Phase 1A:  Coal gas addendum,"The performance and emissions from a rich-lean combustor fired on simulated coal gas fuels were investigated using a 12.7-cm diameter axially-staged burner originally designed for operation with high heating value liquid fuels. A simple, tubular fuel injector was substituted for the liquid fuel nozzle; no other combustor modifications were made. Four test fuels were studied including three chemically bound nitrogen-free gas mixtures with higher heating values of 88, 227, and 308 kj/mol (103, 258 and 349  Btu/scf), and a 227 kj/mol (258 Btu/scf) heating value doped with ammonia to produce a fuel nitrogen content of 0.5% (wt). Stable, ultra-low nitrogen oxide, smoke-free combustion was attained for the nitrogen-free fuels. Results with the doped fuel indicated that less than 5% conversion of NH3 to nitrogen oxide levels below Environmental Protection Agency limits could be achieved. In some instances, excessive CO levels were encountered. It is shown that use of a burner design employing a less fuel-rich primary zone than that found optimum for liquid fuels would yield more acceptable CO emissions.",2013-09-04,1982-01-01,/api/citations/19820010816/downloads/19820010816.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The conjecture is pursued that these precursor objects are initially supermassive Schwarzschild black holes with accretion disks radiating near the Eddington luminosity limit. It is noted that after approx. 10 to the 8th power years these central black holes are spun-up to a canonical Kerr equilibrium state (A/M = 0.998; Thorne 1974) and shown how they then can lead to spectral evolution involving non-thermal emission extending to gamma rays, at the expense of reduced thermal disk radiation. That major portion of the CXB remaining after the contribution of usual AGN are considered, while a superposition of AGN sources at z  1 can account for the gamma ray background.

The composite systems were 49 volume percent boron fibers (203 micron diameter) in aluminum-alloy matrices 1100 Al, 2024 Al, 3003 Al, 5052 Al, and 6061 Al. Specimens were thermally exposed up to 10,000 hours at 500 K and 590 K, up to 500 hours at 730 K, and up to 10,000 hours at 500 K and 590 K, up to 500 hours at 730 K, and up to 2000 thermal cycles between 200 K and 590 K. Composite longitudinal and transverse tensile strengths, longitudinal compression strength, and in-plane shear strength were determined. None of the systems was severely degraded by exposure at 590 K. The best performing system was B-2024 Al. Effects of matrix alloys on degradation mechanisms were experimentally investigated. Composite specimens and individual fibers were metallurgically analyzed with a scanning electron microscope and an electron microprobe to determine failure characteristics, chemical element distribution, and reaction layer morphology. Alloying constituents were found to be affect the composite degradation mechanisms as follows: alloys containing iron, but without manganese as a stabilizer, caused increased low-temperature degradation; alloys containing magnesium, iron, or manganese caused increased degradation; and alloys containing copper caused increased fiber strength.",2013-09-04,1982-04-01,/api/citations/19820014443/downloads/19820014443.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Identical gas mixtures were bubbled into a blank containing only pure water. After exposure each solution was analyzed for pH and sulfate. It was found that NO2 greatly enhances the oxidation of SO2 to sulfate in the presence of carbon particles. The amount of sulfate found in the blanks was significantly less.

Omission errors occur when pixels of fields already visited and known to be of a particular cover type, are classified as some other cover type. Overall error is the proportion of pixels incorrectly classified, without regard to omission or commission.

A key input to this contextural classifier is a quantitative characterization of this tendency: the context function.

This sensitivity reduction is generally pronounced the denser, the vegetation cover and the higher the frequency of observation. The effect of vegetation cover is also examined with respect to the measured polarization factor at both frequencies.

Surface temperatures from a hand-held radiometer and sodar data were collected simultaneously on seven days between mid-July and mid-October 1980. The comparison of the RDMS and sodar heat fluxes proved disappointing. Free convection conditions, required to produce sodar-derived heat fluxes, were inhibited by a terrain-induced low level inversion. Only three out of seven cases produced meaningful sodar heat fluxes. Of those three cases, one had good agreement and the other two had sodar heat fluxes 15 to 45 w/sq m lower than the RDMS values. Since the RDMS method is relatively untested, it was impossible to conclusively determine its validity from the results.

It is shown that no combination of dark, nonbaryonic matter can either provide a cosmological density parameter value near unity or, as in the case of high energy neutrinos, allow formation of condensed matter at epochs when quasars already existed. The possibility that correlations among galactic clusters are scale-free is discussed. Such a distribution of matter would yield a fractal of 1.2, close to a one-dimensional universe. Biasing, cosmic superstrings, and percolated explosions and hot dark matter are theoretical approaches that would satisfy the D = 1.2 fractal model of the large-scale structure of the universe and which would also allow sufficient dark matter in halos to close the universe.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870024830,SOLAR PHYSICS,A siphon mechanism for supplying prominence mass,"A siphonlike mechanism for moving mass from the chromosphere to a gravitational well at the top of a magnetic loop to form a prominence is examined. The calculations assume no a priori flow velocity at the loop base. Instead, heating in the loop legs drives the flow. The prominence formation process requires two steps. First, the background heating rate must be reduced to on the order of 1 percent of the initial heating rate required to maintain the coronal loop. This forms an initial condensation at the top of the loop. Second, the heating must take place only in the loop legs in order to produce a pressure differential which drives mass up into the well at the top of the loop. The heating rate in the loop must be increased once the prominence has begun to form, or full prominence densities cannot be achieved in a reasonable time. It is concluded that this heating driven siphonlike mechanism is feasible for producing and maintaining prominences.",2013-08-13,1986-04-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870024987,PLASMA PHYSICS,The evolution of nonlinear Alfven waves subject to growth and damping,"The effects of wave amplification (by streaming particle distributions) and damping (by ion-cyclotron resonance absorption) on the nonlinear evolution of Alfven waves are investigated theoretically. The results of numerical simulations based on the derivative-Schroedinger-equation model of Spangler and Sheerin (1983 and 1985) are presented graphically and characterized in detail, with an emphasis on astrophysical applications. Three phases of wave-packet evolution (linear, nonlinear-saturation, and postsaturation quasi-steady) are identified, and nonlinearity is found to transfer wave energy from growing or amplified wavenumbers to wavenumbers affected by damping. It is pointed out that although there are similarities between the solitonlike pulses predicted by the simulations and short-wavelength shocklet structures observed in the earth bow shock, the model does not explain why low-frequency waves stop growing in the vicinity of the bow shock.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870025000,GEOPHYSICS,New aspects of the equilibrium pole tide,"A new spherical harmonic algorithm is developed for the calculation of the loading and self-gravitating equilibrium pole tide. Based on a suggestion of Dahlen (1976), this approach minimizes the distortions in tide height caused by an incomplete representation of the ocean function. With slight modification this approach easily could be used to compute self-gravitating and loading lunisolar tides as well. Using the algorithm, the static pole tide is compared with tide observations at a variety of locations around the world, and statistically significant evidence for pole tide enhancements is found in midocean as well as the shallow seas. Also included is a reinvestigation of the effect of the static tide on the Chandler-wobble period. The difference between the wobble period of an oceanless elastic earth with a fluid core (Smith and Dahlen, 1981) and the period of an earth minus static oceans yields a 7.4-day discrepancy. It is concluded from tide observations that much of the discrepancy can probably be accounted for by nonequilibrium pole-tide behavior in the deep oceans.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Included are an evaluation of the LC error spectra, a summary of independent-observation calibrations of the error estimates of the Goddard Earth Models (GEM) 9 and L2 (Lerch et al., 1977, 1979, 1982, 1983, and 1985), a comparison of GEM-L2 with GRIM-3B (Reigber et al., 1983), a comparison of recent models with LAGEOS laser ranging, and a summary of resonant-orbit model tests. It is concluded that the accuracy of GEMs 9, 10, and L2 is much higher than claimed by LC, that the GEMs are in good agreement with independent observations and with GRIM-3B, and that the GEM calibrations were adequate. In a reply by LC, a number of specific questions regarding the error estimates are addressed, and it is pointed out that the intermodel discrepancies of the greatest geophysical interest are those in the higher-order coefficients, not discussed in the present comment. It is argued that the differences among the geoid heights of even the most recent models are large enough to call for considerable improvements.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870025014,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,The solar nebula redox state as recorded by the most reduced chondrules of five primitive chondrites,"Mafic minerals in the most reduced chondrules of five primitive meteorites were analyzed with an electron microprobe to determine the lower limit on their FeO contents. The accuracy obtained was + or - 0.01 weight percent FeO. The thermodynamic relationship between mole fraction FeSiO3 and pO2 of the ambient nebular gas at the time of mineral equilibration was established, and was used to infer the local O/H ratio of the nebular gas during chondrule formation. The lowest ferrosilite compositions reflected equilibration at 1500 K with a gas 2-18 times more oxidizing than a gas of solar composition. Olivines in low-FeO unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (UOC) chondrules are uniformly more FeO-rich than coexisting pyroxenes. This discrepancy suggests that a significant change in the O/H ratio of the nebular gas occurred between the time of olivine and pyroxene crystallization in the region of the nebula where UOCs formed. Mineral compositions in the chondrules of two C2 chondrites studied suggest they formed in a more homogeneous region of the nebula than the UOCs.",2013-08-13,1986-07-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Analysis using two methods demonstrated that the ratio of tangential discontinuities (TDs) to rotational discontinuities (RDs) decreased with decreasing radial distance. Decreases in average discontinuity thickness of 41 percent between 1.0 and 0.72 AU, and 56 percent between 1.0 and 0.46 AU, were found for both TDs and RDs, in agreement with Pioneer 10 data between 1 and 5 AU. Normalization of the individual DD thicknesses with respect to the estimated local proton gyroradius (R sub L) gave a nearly constant average thickness at the three locations, 36 + or - 5 R sub L, for both RDs and TDs.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870025031,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Altitude variation of EUV emissions and evidence for proton precipitation at low latitudes in the Saturnian atmosphere,"Extreme ultraviolet observations of Saturn from Voyager 1 and 2 are analyzed. The Lyman alpha and H2 band emissions extend throughout the upper atmosphere, from the hydrocarbon homopause to well above the exobase. Analysis of the Lyman alpha emissions with a radiative transfer model indicates that the Lyman alpha source temperature is very high. This suggests that energetic protons or hydrogen atoms are responsible for a fraction of the emissions. Calculation of the solar-scattered component of the emissions based on the neutral atmosphere of Smith et al. (1983) reveals that only 1-2 kR out of a total of 3.5 kR of the observed Lyman alpha intensity is due to solar scatter for the Voyager 2 disk observations; the remainder of the Lyman alpha emissions are collisionally excited. The Lyman alpha and H2 bands are constant in longitude but decrease in local time by a factor of 2 from dawn to dusk. This correlation of the Lyman alpha and H2 band intensities is further evidence that most of the Lyman alpha is collisionally excited.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870025032,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Continued observations of the H Ly alpha emission from Uranus,"Observations of Uranus obtained over four years with the IUE Observatory supports the initial identification of a bright H Ly alpha flux which varies independently of the solar H Ly alpha flux, implying a largely self-excited emission. An average brightness of 1400 Rayleighs is derived, and limits for the possible contribution by reflected solar H Ly alpha emission, estimated to be about 200 Rayleighs, suggest that the remaining self-excited emission is produced by an aurora. Based on comparison with solar wind measurements obtained in the vicinity of Uranus by Voyager 2 and Pioneer 11, no evidence for correlation between the solar wind density and the H Ly alpha brightness is found. The upper limit to H2 emission gives a lower limit to the ratio of H Ly alpha/H2 emissions of about 2.4, suggesting that the precipitating particles may be significantly less energetic on Uranus than those responsible for the aurora on Jupiter. The average power in precipitating particles is estimated to be of the order of 10 to the 12th W.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870025056,GEOPHYSICS,Earth's compressional foreshock boundary revisited Observations by the ISEE 1 magnetometer,"A 'solar foreshock coordinate' (SFC) system is introduced in which the positions of foreshock components can be collated with a minimum of assumptions about the physical processes involved. Location behind the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) tangent surface to the bow shock and rotational symmetry around the solar wind flow (X) axis are the only presuppositions. The SFC system has been applied to over 300 observations of the boundary of the ULF compressional waves recorded by ISEE 1's magnetometer in 1978 and 1979. The boundary locations form a coherent pattern in the SFC frame. A selection of those cases for which the cone angle of the IMF was between 40 and 50 deg, corresponding to the average stream angle, yields a least square line whose mapping back to the solar ecliptic coordinates frame has slope of about 85 deg, very close to that of the tangent ULF boundary deduced earlier from more primitive methods with entirely different data sets. The line, being parallel to neither the IMF, the typical reflected beam, nor the shock, cannot be compatible with any model of wave production by beam-solar wind interaction that depends on uniform beam distribution or fixed growth rate. Rather, its tangency suggests the influence of a separate, escaping ion population.",2013-08-13,1986-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Such vehicles could be based on the proposed space station and used to transport commercial satellites from the space station to geostationary orbits or to polar orbits and return. During a mission, AOTVs would fly through earth's atmosphere, thus generating aerodynamic forces that could be used for decelerating the vehicles or changing their direction. AOTV research findings were concerned with the shock-wave-induced, high-temperature airflows that would be produced around these vehicles during atmospheric flight. Special emphasis was placed on the problems of: (1) the chemical physics of multitemperature, ionizing, nonequilibrium air flows, and (2) the dynamics of the flows in the base region of a blunt body with complex afterbody geometry.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The site was a Williams loam soil (fine-loamy mixed, Typic Argiborolls) near Sidney, Montana. Radiances were measured with a truck-mounted radiometer. The radiometer was equipped with four wavelength bands: 0.45 to 0.52, 0.52 to 0.60, 0.63 to 0.69, and 0.76 to 0.90 micron. Airborne scanner measurements were made at an altitude of 600 m four times during the season under clear sky conditions.

Comparisons using individual wave bands, the near IR/red, (0.76 to 0.90 micron)/(0.63 to 0.69 micron) ratio and the normalized difference vegetation index, ND = (IR - red)/(IR + red), showed that only during limited times during the growing season were some of the small grains distinguishable from one another and from native rangeland vegetation.

The formalism is based on spherical harmonics; it produces equations which hold regardless of whether the terminator is seen by the satellite or not. Specializing to the case of a realistic zonal albedo shows that Lageos' orbital semimajor axis changes periodically by only a few millimeters and the eccentricity by one part in 100,000. The longitude of the node increases secularly.

The basic form of the geotherm is interpreted on the basis of two dominant mechanisms by which heat is transported in the earth: (1) conduction through the rock, and (2) advection by thermal flow. Data reveal that: (1) the temperature distributions through continental lithosphere and through oceanic lithosphere more than 60 million years old are practically indistinguishable, (2) crustal uplift is instrumental in modifying continental geotherms, and (3) the average temperature through the Archean crust and mantle was similar to that at present.

Observational upper limits on coronal fluid velocities are of the order of 25 km/sec, which may not apply to the transparent coronal hole. Alternatively it has been suggested that coronal holes may be heated by agitation from neighboring active regions, suggesting that the vigor of a coronal hole depends upon its location. The Ulysses Mission will provide a direct comparison of the strength of the high speed wind from coronal holes at low latitude and coronal holes at high latitude, from which the nature of the presently unknown energy sources of the coronal holes and the resulting structure of the heliosphere may be better judged.

The Sakigake magnetometer data during the early part of the mission (February-March 1985) are well interpreted by an eastward shift of the tilting neutral sheet. The shift is further explained by an effect of a new giant region appearing at about 10 deg heliolatitude and about 50 deg Carrington longitude in August 1984. The toward polarity ratio of IMF observed by Sakigake changed from about 22 percent in February to about 62 percent in early June and then increased rapidly up to 98 percent. This ratio is interpreted as a decrease of the tilt angle of the sheet down to only about 4 deg.

From these error models, new insights about the applicability of the different filters and their sensitivity to round-off, is obtained. It is shown that the CKF may become completely unreliable when the original plant is unstable, and that this is easily circumvented by a number of techniques. The square root filters, often quoted to possess a conditioning or sensitivity that is the square root of that of the CKF, are shown to possess this property only for the computation of the covariance of the filtered signal and not for the computation of the Kalman gain or the filtered estimate.

The model places particular emphasis on the contrarotating vortex pair associated with the jet, and predicts the flame length and shape based on entrainment of the oxidizer by the fuel jet. Effects of buoyancy and density variations in the flame are neglected in order to isolate the effects of large-scale mixing. The results are compared with a simulation of the transverse reacting jet in a liquid (acid-base) system. For a wide range of ratios of the cross flow to jet velocity, the model predicts flame length quite well. In particular, the observed transitional behavior in the flame length between cross-flow velocity to jet velocity of orifice ratios of 0.0 to 0.1, yielding an approximate minimum at the ratio 0.05, is reproduced very clearly by the present model. The transformation in flow structure that accounts for this minimum arises from the differing components of vorticity dominant in the near-field and far-field regions of the jet.",2013-08-13,1986-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Extensive comparisons between MCPF and complete-active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)/MRCI calculations with natural orbital iterations, and studies with more extensive basis sets, show this level of treatment to supply an accurate and cost-effective treatment of these systems. For the transition metal hydrides, the bonding can arise from either the 3d(n)4s(2) or 3d(n + 1)4s(1) atomic asymptotes, or a mixture of both.

Despite conditions that appeared to be optimal for the critical velocity effect, the particle data, in agreement with optical observations, indicates that a fractional ionization of only approximately .0005 was observed, indicating that the conditions required for the effect to occur are still not well understood. However many of the required phenomena associated with the CIV effect were observed; in particular a superthermal electron population was formed at the expense of ion drift kinetic energy in the presence of intense electrostatic waves near the lower hybrid frequency. The amount of ionization produced is plausibly consistent with the observed electron flux, but could also be accounted for by residual solar UV at the injection point. It is shown based on the data set that one obvious explanation for the low ionization efficiency, namely that the ionizing superthermal electrons may rapidly escape along field lines, can be ruled out.",2013-08-13,1986-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

By the use of Green's functions and the complex variable theory of orthotropic elasticity, a set of integral equations is obtained. The integral equations are replaced by an equivalent set of algebraic equations, which are solved to obtain the shear stress distribution in the adhesive layer, with which the crack-tip stress-intensity factors are found. When the adhesive was modeled with a nonlinear stress-strain curve, the peak shear stresses in the adhesive were considerably reduced in comparison to the solution for the linear elastic adhesive. This resulted in increases in the stress-intensity factors for the nonlinear adhesive solution compared to the linear adhesive solution. The nonlinear adhesive has no significant effect on the stress-intensity factor unless the near crack tip is beneath the stringer. It is assumed that the adhesive bond remains intact and it is predicted that onset of adhesive failure occurs at decreasing levels of applied stress as the crack propagates beneath the stringer.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is shown that at high altitudes the velocity component of the ions along the magnetic field may be increased by more than an order of magnitude. The highest velocities are acquired by ions that escape from the region of the ionosphere that is connected along magnetic field lines to the dayside cusps. During disturbed times, ions from that region intercept the center plane of the magnetotail in one to two hours at radial distances exceeding about 6 earth radii. Investigation of the resulting O(+) properties in the center plane, viz., their locations, number densities, and energies, indicates that the polar ionosphere near the cusps is the principal source of the O(+) observed in the plasma sheet. Moreover, a study of the ion motion at quiet and disturbed times indicates that the increase of O(+) in the plasma sheet with increasing AE values (Lennartsson and Shelley, 1986) is due mainly to an increase in the source of O(+) rather than alteration of its transport path.",2013-08-13,1986-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The cyclic energy flows in this region are related to the temperature gradient along the piston and cylinder partition walls, the reciprocating motion of the piston, the pressure variation in the Stirling cycle and the leakage flow across the cold-end seal. This paper outlines a numerical model to simulate these cyclic energy flows and the subsequent effort to correlate it with engine test data. The sensitivity of the appendix gap loss to selected parameters and comparisons with test results are presented.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870030837,ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,Spacecraft solid state power distribution switch,"As a spacecraft performs its mission, various loads are connected to the spacecraft power bus in response to commands from an on board computer, a function called power distribution. For the Mariner Mark II set of planetary missions, the power bus is 30 volts dc and when loads are connected or disconnected, both the bus and power return side must be switched. In addition, the power distribution function must be immune to single point failures and, when power is first applied, all switches must be in a known state. Traditionally, these requirements have been met by electromechanical latching relays. This paper describes a solid state switch which not only satisfies the requirements but incorporates several additional features including soft turn on, programmable current trip point with noise immunity, instantaneous current limiting, and direct telemetry of load currents and switch status. A breadboard of the design has been constructed and some initial test results are included.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The Pegassus Drive is the coupling of this nuclear electric power system with a 6 MWe MPD thruster. The power system has a maximum power output of 8.5 MWe. The MPD thruster requires 6 MWe to provide spacecraft propulsion and 1.5 MWe are available for mission-specific tasks and experiments. The balance of power generated is used to operate the power system. The size and mass limitations of the STS are of prime consideration in the design of this system to allow the collapsed system to be placed in lower earth orbit by two Shuttle missions. The main system (19,120 kg) employing a shadow shield would require one launch and the balance of the four-pi shield (27,830 kg) would occupy the second launch.

If most of the accreted mass is contained in planetesimals larger that about 1 km, the critical core mass for runaway accretion will not significantly change when planetesimal dissolution is taken into account; it is accordingly suggested that giant planet envelopes should contain above-solar proportions of virtually all elements, relative to hydrogen.",2013-08-13,1986-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

As CO2 increases, it may lead to increased methane production and a resulting enhancement of the expected greenhouse warming.

Rate of arcing, preferential arc paths, speed of arc interruption, and response of thrustors to voltage transients are also discussed. The study indicates that arcing is a system hazard and that arcing rates are of prime importance in the design and development of thrustors, thrustor arrays, and system components. Two system models for reducing the hazard are proposed, based on principles developed herein, published data, and experience available from operation of nine-module electron-bombardment thrustor array.

The cause and a cure of this divergence are discussed here.

Electron correlation was incorporated, using single-plus-double configuration interaction, the coupled pair functional (CPF) formalism of Ahlrichs et al.

The spectroscopic parameters D(e), r(e), and mu(e) determined for the low-lying states are compared with the available experimental data and previous theoretical results. In contrast to the first-row TM hydrides studied earlier (Chong et al., 1986), the spectroscopic constants for the second-row TM hydrides were found to be much less sensitive to the level of correlation treatment.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870041495,OPTICS,A coupled mode formulation by reciprocity and a variational principle,"A coupled mode formulation for parallel dielectric waveguides is presented via two methods: a reciprocity theorem and a variational principle. In the first method, a generalized reciprocity relation for two sets of field solutions satisfying Maxwell's equations and the boundary conditions in two different media, respectively, is derived. Based on the generalized reciprocity theorem, the coupled mode equations can then be formulated. The second method using a variational principle is also presented for a general waveguide system which can be lossy. The results of the variational principle can also be shown to be identical to those from the reciprocity theorem. The exact relations governing the 'conventional' and the new coupling coefficients are derived. It is shown analytically that the present formulation satisfies the reciprocity theorem and power conservation exactly, while the conventional theory violates the power conservation and reciprocity theorem by as much as 55 percent and the Hardy-Streifer (1985, 1986) theory by 0.033 percent, for example.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Solar wind He-4(2+) kinetic temperatures, densities, and velocities before, during, and after the encounter are presented. These data combined with He-4(2+) velocity distributions provide evidence for the existence of a thick diffuse shock. Relative abundances of water group ions and CO(+) are derived along with an estimate of the abundance of an ion with M/Q = 24 + or - 1 amu/e. The ICI data are compared with electron data from two other experiments (Bame et al., 1986; Meyer-Vernet et al., 1986) and found to be in reasonable agreement in the region outside the tail. Spectroscopic data for several neutral and ionic species are compared with the ICI results for the water group ions and CO(+).

On the basis of these results it is argued that solar wind couples momentum (and energy) to the barium ions through both laminar and turbulent processes. The laminar forces acting on the particles are the laminar electric and magnetic fields; the turbulent forces are associated with the intense electrostatic wave activity. This wave activity is shown to be caused by a cross-field solar wind proton-barium ion streaming instability. The observed wave frequencies and saturated amplitudes are consistent with the theoretical analysis.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Data from the energetic particle anisotropy spectrometer (EPAS) instrument on ISEE 3 are studied, along with magnetic field data from the vector helium magnetometer.

The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and structure of the lobe-plasma sheet boundary layer. The analysis shows that the lobeward edge of the boundary is consistent with a freestanding slow mode shock. This shock is followed by a slow compression wave containing a trailing ion cyclotron wave which also stands in the flow. Measurement of the cross-tail current in the shock and the current system within the wave gives a shock thickness and wavelength comparable to but larger than both the upstream ion inertial length and the downstream proton gyroradius. Equality of the shock thickness with the standing ion cyclotron wavelength suggests that the steepness of the front is limited by dispersion rather than current-driven anomalous resistivity.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870041537,GEOPHYSICS,On the generation of field-aligned plasma flow at the boundary of the plasma sheet,"A possible cause of the large plasma flow velocities parallel to the magnetic field (which were observed in spacecraft experiments) near the boundary of the plasma sheet in the earth's magnetotail is considered in the framework of a magnetohydrodynamic model. It is shown for steady-state configurations that high parallel flow velocities can be expected to exist on field lines connecting to a region of weak magnetic field. The physical mechanism causing large values of the parallel velocity component can be visualized as a strong imbalance of perpendicular mass flux into and out of magnetic flux tubes passing through regions where the magnetic field is weak and inhomogeneous. The value of the parallel velocity component is evaluated, and it is found that it can substantially exceed the perpendicular velocity (by as much as a factor of 40). The results are applied to the earth's magnetotail; it is found that this mechanism is able to explain the parallel flow velocities near the boundary of the plasma sheet in the range of several hundreds of km/s.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Fluid shifts, hemodynamic variables, and indices of myocardial contractility were evaluated by utilizing electrocardiography, systolic time intervals, impedance cardiography, sphygmomanometry, and measurement of calf circumference. Most cardiovascular variables remained stable throughout the initial 30 min of the protocol, even though translocation of fluid from the legs to the thorax commenced immediately with the onset of head-down tilt. In contrast, minutes 30-60 were characterized by reduced stroke volume, cardiac output, mean stroke ejection rate, and Heather index concomitant with an elevation in mean arterial pressure. Intrathoracic fluid volume continued to increase, while leg volume continued to decrease.

19870042208,OCEANOGRAPHY,Dynamics of the North Sea pole tide reconsidered,"The anomalous tide in the North Sea, driven by the Chandler wobble, is here re-examined. A previously published solution in which these 'pole tide' observations were explained as a forced co-oscillation from the deep water tide is shown to be untenable, because it is very unlikely that the deep ocean tide is anything but equilibrium. Using the same physics as in the previous solution (viscous, linear, quasi-geostrophic dynamics), it is now suggested that the only plausible explanation is that there is a coincidental resonance between the long-wavelength branch topographic Rossby wave of the North Sea and the direct driving by the pole tide potential. This resonance is not a basin-resonance, but that of a free wave driven by a travelling forcing function. Simplified models reproduce the observations in qualitative fashion. If this explanation is the correct one, then the Arctic seas north of Asia and North America appear to be likely candidates as other regions where there may be a large pole tide response and, hence, a locus of wobble dissipation. Given the difficulties of observation, the long times required, and the general instability of the dissipation calculation with the simplified analytical model, probably a numerical model will be required for further progress.",2013-08-13,1986-12-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Two parameters determine the angular scale and orientation, while three determine the configuration of the images. A comprehensive investigation of the SIST lens is performed, including the variation of the configurations with the parameter values, the critical surfaces in the parameter space, and the extremal solutions. Analytic expressions are derived for the SIST parameters, and additional image positions, in the case when the intensity ratio and positions relative to the galaxy for two of the images are given as input.

The trapping arises because nonneutral plasma can be stably trapped within such a magnetosphere provided the overall system charge is nonzero. It has been argued that particles from the interstellar medium would discharge this system, thereby presumably reactivating the system as a pulsar. However, radiation pressure either precludes such discharging (requiring an alternative source of ionization) or pulsar magnetic moments must be almost perfectly aligned with the spin axis (a revolutionary alternative). Indeed, the pulsars for which particles could reach the neutron star are those with periods of at least 3 sec. But those periods are where pulsars become inactive, not active.

If the field is treated as a continuum, the interior magnetic topology is uniquely specified by the displacement of the boundaries, while the topology of a field made up of discrete flux tubes is not determined by the boundary displacement.

The technique permits measurement of the complex, multichannel reflectivity of a scene on a single aircraft pass and to late reprocess the data to provide multiple image maps, with each representing the backscattered energy from the scene measured with a different combination of observational transmit and recieve polarizations. The resulting polarization signature measurements indicate optimum polarizations for observations of certain classes of objects and give insight into the identification of dominant scattering mechanisms for each kind of object. The mathematical model for polarization synthesis is summarized, and some theoretical polarization measurements are illustrated for several types of targets.

For MPSK, introducing nonuniformity (asymmetry) into the spacing between signal points in the constellation buys a further improvement in performance over that achievable with trellis coded symmetric MPSK, all this without increasing average or peak power, or changing the bandwidth constraints imposed on the system. Whereas previous contributions have considered the performance of trellis coded modulation transmitted over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the emphasis in the paper is on the performance of trellis coded MPSK in the fading environment. The results will be obtained by using a combination of analysis and simulation. It will be assumed that the effect of the fading on the phase of the received signal is fully compensated for either by tracking it with some form of phase-locked loop or with pilot tone calibration techniques. Thus, results will reflect only the degradation due to the effect of the fading on the amplitude of the received signal. Also, we shall consider only the case where interleaving/deinterleaving is employed to further combat the fading. This allows for considerable simplification of the analysis and is of great practical interest.

This analysis shows that backward curvature of a wing improves induced efficiency to a value greater than that of the flat untwisted wing of elliptical shape considered optimal in classical wing theory (Prandt, 1921 and Munk, 1921).

Techniques for determining if brown dwarfs are a significant component of the missing mass are discussed, as are improved models which would use limited numbers of tracer stars to set further constraints on the amount and distribution of the missing mass.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870043649,OCEANOGRAPHY,Equatorial long-wave characteristics determined from satellite sea surface temperature and in situ data,"SST maps and imagery derived from the NOAA 6 satellite AVHRR for June and July 1981 in the eastern tropical Pacific portray the wavelike structure of the cool water along the equator from 93 deg W to 125 deg W. Cusped waves of approximately 1000-km zonal wavelength and 25-day period propagated westward with a phase speed of 40 km/day. The observed meridional extent between the crest and trough of the waves is about 300 km. Details in the imagery show cooler water at the cusps advected north and then east with the north equatorial countercurrent (NECC), consistent with the suggestion of a series of anticyclonic eddies occupying the shear zone between the NECC and the westward flowing south equatorial current. Absolute SST estimates from the AVHRR data agree to within 0.6 C with shipboard data taken along 110 deg W between 5 deg N and 5 deg S. The wavelike structures in the SST maps are also in agreement at the surface with a vertical expendable bathythermograph temperature section made along the equator between 93 deg W and 125 deg W, which shows the phase of the waves tilting westward with increasing depth over the upper 75 m. Such a phase shift, if it extended 100-200 km meridionally in either direction from the equator, would be associated with an equatorward flux of heat. Similar phase shifts appear in temperature time series at depths of 20 and 50 m, from a mooring at 0-deg 33-min N, 110-deg 30-min W. Near-surface currents measured at this and a second mooring on the equator at 109-deg 40-min W indicate a regular pattern of northward advection when wave cusps pass them, followed by southwest flow during the passage of wave troughs, again consistent with an equatorward flux of heat, as well as with earlier theoretical and drift buoy findings.",2013-08-13,1987-01-15,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870043650,OCEANOGRAPHY,Seasonal variability of the Gulf Stream from satellite altimetry,"The nearly continuous 3.5 years of altimeter data in the western North Atlantic Ocean from the GEOS 3 mission (April 1975 to November 1978) have been used to study the seasonal variability of the Gulf Stream. The differences between altimetric measurements of sea surface height made at satellite ground track intersections, called crossovers, are utilized to construct time series of sea level variations. The results indicate that the Gulf Stream in the region off Cape Hatteras has a pronounced seasonal variability. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the seasonal cycle in terms of cross-stream sea level difference is about 15 cm, with a maximum in April and a minimum in December. The result is in good agreement with historic hydrographic observations and recent direct measurements of the Gulf Stream. The mechanisms responsible for the observed seasonal variability are discussed.",2013-08-13,1987-01-15,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870043668,SOLID-STATE PHYSICS,High temperature (900-1300 C) mechanical behaviour of dendritic web grown silicon ribbons - Strain rate and temperature dependence of the yield stress,"The mechanical behavior of dendritic web Si ribbons close the melting point was studied experimentally. The goal of the study was to generate data for modeling the generation of stresses and dislocation structures during growth of dendritic web Si ribbons, thereby permitting modifications to the production process, i.e., the temperature profile, to lower production costs for the photovoltaic ribbons. A laser was used to cut specimens in the direction of growth of sample ribbons, which were then subjected to tensile tests at temperatures up to 1300 C in an Ar atmosphere. The tensile strengths of the samples increased when the temperature rose above 1200 C, a phenomena which was attributed to the diffusion of oxygen atoms to the quasi-dislocation sites. The migration to the potential dislocations sites effectively locked the dislocations.",2013-08-13,1987-02-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Forces and moments were measured on a large ogive-cylinder store in the presence of a 45 deg swept-wing-fuselage bomber configuration for a number of store locations below the fuselage center line.  Results of the investigation show that large variations of store lift, drag, and pitch occur with changes in store or airplane angle of attack, store vertical location, and store horizontal location. The variation of the store forces and moments with respect to the chordwise location of the wing plan form indicates that the wing is a large factor in producing the interference loads on the store. Comparison of data for underfuselage and underwing store locations at an angle of attack of 0 deg showed maximum store drag interferences of similar magnitudes, but showed considerably smaller maximum interference on store lift an pitching moments for underfuselage store locations.",2013-08-02,1957-01-14,/api/citations/19650003116/downloads/19650003116.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19870053739,STRUCTURAL MECHANICS,"The effects of pin elasticity, clearance, and friction on the stresses in a pin-loaded orthotropic plate","The effects of pin elasticity, clearance, and friction on the stresses in a pin loaded orthotropic plate are studied. The effects are studied by posing the problem as a planar contact elasticity problem, the pin and the plate being two elastic bodies which interact through contact. Coulomb friction is assumed, the pin loads the plate in one of its principal material directions, and the plate is infinite in extent. A collocation scheme and interaction, in conjunction with a complex variable series solution, are used to obtain numerical results. The contact region between the plate and pin is unknown and must be solved for as part of the solution. The same is true of the region of friction induced no slip. Two pin stiffnesses, two clearance levels, two friction levels and two laminates, a (0/+ or - 45/90)s and a (02/+ or - 45)s, are studied. The effects of pin elasticity, clearance, and friction on the load capacity of the plate are assessed by comparing the load capacity of the plate with the capacity when the pin is rigid, perfectly fitting, and frictionless.",2013-08-13,1987-03-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870053804,NONMETALLIC MATERIALS,Effects of milling brominated P-100 graphite fibers,"Preliminary procedures have been developed for the ball milling of pristine and brominated P-100 graphite fibers. Because of the lubricative properties of graphite, large ball loads (50 percent by volume) are required. Use of 2-propanol as a milling medium enhances the efficiency of the process. The fibers, when allowed to settle from the milling medium, tend to be preferentially aligned with rather few fibers standing up. Milled, brominated P-100 fibers have resistivities that are indistinguishable from their pristine counterparts, apparently because of loss of bromine. This suggests that bromine would not be the intercalate of choice in applications where milled fibers of this type are required. It was found that brominated graphite fibers are stable in a wide variety of organic solvents.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870053828,SPACECRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Experimental study of low Reynolds number nozzles,"High-performance electrothermal thrusters operate in a low nozzle-throat Reynolds number regime. Under these conditions, the flow boundary layer occupies a large volume inside the nozzle, contributing to large viscous losses. Four nozzles (conical, bell, trumpet, and modified trumpet) and a sharp-edged orifice were evaluated over a Reynolds number range of 500 to 9000 with unheated nitrogen and hydrogen. The nozzles showed significant decreases in specific impulse efficiency with decreasing Reynolds number. At Reynolds numbers less than 1000, all four nozzles were probably filled with a large boundary layer. The discharge coefficient decreased with Reynolds number in the same manner as the specific impulse efficiency. The bell and modified trumpet nozzles had discharge coefficients 4 to 8 percent higher than those of the cone or trumpet nozzles. The Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) nozzle analysis computer program was used to predict nozzle performance. The results were then compared to the experimental results in order to determine the accuracy of the program within this flow regime.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Ion engine operation at a nominal 4.0 ampere beam current and 30.0 volt discharge gives a specific impulse of 3310 sec, a total engine efficiency of 64.3 percent, and a thrust-to-power ratio of 39.5 mN/kW at an input power level of 5.10 kW. These modified J series ion engines are shown to be capable of throttling over an 8:1 range from a power level of 5.48 kW at 3285 sec to a power level of 0.70 kW at 1856 sec.

19870053853,SPACECRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,Arcjet component conditions through a multistart test,"A low power, dc arcjet thruster was tested for starting reliability using hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures simulating the decomposition products of hydrazine. More than 300 starts were accumulated in phases with extended burn-in periods interlaced. A high degree of flow stabilization was built into the arcjet and the power supply incorporated both rapid current regulation and a high voltage, pulsed starting circuit. A nominal current level of 10 A was maintained throughout the test. Photomicrographs of the cathode tip showed a rapid recession to a steady-state operating geometry. A target of 300 starts was selected, as this represents significantly more than anticipated (150 to 240), in missions of 10 yr or less duration. Weighings showed no apparent mass loss. Some anode erosion was observed, particularly at the entrance to the constrictor. This was attributed to the brief period during startup the arc mode attachment point spends in the high pressure region upstream of the nozzle. Based on the results obtained, startup does not appear to be performance or life limiting for the number of starts typical of operational satellite applications.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

For the plant tissues, the data reveal that mung bean sprouts contain homoglutathione and no glutathione; alfalfa sprouts contain homoglutathione and glutathione; the pea seed, nonlegumes, and fungi contain glutathione and no homoglutathione.

19870053882,AIRCRAFT PROPULSION AND POWER,A parametric study of a gas-generator airturbo ramjet (ATR),"Parametric engine performance calculations were carried out for an airturbo ramjet (ATR). A LOX-LH2 rocket powered turbine powered the compressor. The engine was flown over a typical flight path up to Mach 5 to show the effect of engine off design operation. The compressor design efficiency, compressor pressure ratio, rocket turbine efficiency, rocket turbine inlet temperature, and rocket chamber pressure were varied to show their effect on engine net thrust and specific impulse at Mach 5 cruise. Estimates of engine weights as a function of the ratio of compressor air to rocket propellant flow and rocket chamber pressure are also included. In general, the Mach 5 results indicate that increasing the amount of rocket gas produced increased thrust but decreased the specific impulse. The engine performance was fairly sensitive to rocket chamber pressure, especially at higher compressor pressure ratios. At higher compressor pressure ratios, the engine thrust was sensitive to turbine inlet temperature. At all compressor pressure ratios, the engine performance was not sensitive to compressor or turbine efficiency.",2013-08-13,1986-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Correlation of the losses shows a weak dependence on the Weber number and a slightly stronger dependence on the saturated liquid-to-vapor density ratio. The vapor jet thickness, which is crucial to the prediction of the burnout heat flux, and the shape of the vapor film are predicted.

19870053907,PLASMA PHYSICS,A comparative study of plasma heating by ion acoustic and modified two-stream instabilities at subcritical quasi-perpendicular shocks,"Plasma heating due to the ion acoustic instability and the modified two-stream instability is examined for quasi-perpendicular subcritical shocks. Electron and ion heating is investigated as a function of upstream electron to ion temperature ratio and plasma beta using second-order heating rates. A simple shock model is employed in which the cross-field electron-ion drift speed is adjusted until the total (adiabatic plus anomalous) heating matches that required by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Quantities such as the width of the shock and the maximum electric field fluctuations are also calculated, and the results are compared with the ISEE data set of subcritical bow shock crossings. The observed width of the shock, the amount of plasma heating, and the low-frequency electric field intensity are in reasonably good agreement with the calculations for the modified two-stream instability. On the other hand, the wave intensities at higher frequency are about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted for the ion acoustic instability at saturation, consistent with the fact that the measured shock widths imply cross-field drift speeds that are below threshold for this instability. It is therefore concluded that the dissipation at these shocks is most likely due to the lowest frequency, modified two-stream instability.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870053918,GEOPHYSICS,A possible energy source to power stable auroral red arcs - Precipitating electrons,"Results of coincident measurements by ground-based photometers and the low-altitude plasma instrument on board the Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite are presented that demonstrate the association of precipitating low-energy electrons with stable auroral red (SAR) arcs. A search of available data has yielded 23 instances of DE 2 overflights during the presence of SAR arcs being monitored by the photometers. For each case, downward fluxes of electrons are found to be enhanced along field lines penetrating the arcs in relation to regions both north and south of the features. Modeling of the atmospheric response to these influxes indicates that these electrons can represent a major source of the energy required to establish temperature profiles within the ionospheric electron gas that are sufficient to produce the recorded 6300-A emission rates. The sensitivity of these results to uncertainties of the assumed spacecraft potential and thermospheric composition has been investigated and found to be important, but does not alter the conclusion that precipitating electrons are a fundamental link in the production of SAR arcs.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

It is proposed that the plasma relaxes to a state of low-potential energy subject to a small number of global constraints. The constraints are exactly preserved by all ideal motions and, approximately, by a wide class of motions of the plasma undergoing magnetic reconnection. A variational principle which minimizes the free energy predicts the relaxed state. Exact, two-dimensional solutions of the relaxed state are obtained. A universal feature of the exact solutions is a chain of magnetic islands along the tail axis. Sufficient conditions for the stability of relaxed states are obtained from the second variation of the free-energy functional.",2013-08-13,1987-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Good agreement is found between computational data and previous experimental pitot pressure measurements in the core of the vortex, suggesting that the total pressure losses predicted by the Euler equation solvers are not errors, but realistic predictions.

These findings constitute unambiguous evidence that the N contained in these strata is the end result of biogeochemical processes that differed substantially from those that operated on the N contained in intervening organic carbon-poor strata and younger marine sediments. The data indicate that the low N-15 relative abundance is the consequence of pelagic rather than postdepositional processes. Reduced ocean circulation, increased denitrification, and hence, reduced euphotic zone nitrate availability may have led to Cretaceous phytoplankton assemblages that were periodically dominated by N2-fixing blue-green algae, a possible source of the sedimentary N-15 depletion.",2013-08-13,1987-04-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870064830,ASTROPHYSICS,On the thermal instability of galactic and cluster halos,"The paper presents a detailed study of thermal instabilities in cooling flows associated with galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In the case of purely radiation-driven accretion onto a central object such as the cD galaxy M87, it is found that the gas is largely subject to overstability, rather than to monotonic instability. If thermal conductivity is taken into account, the flow is stabilized on scales of several kiloparsecs, even if the conductivity is appreciably reduced (e.g., about 1 percent) with respect to the Spitzer value. In no case are the globular perturbations (i.e., perturbations with comparable radial and azimuthal dimensions) found to be monotonically unstable. The paper presents numerical solutions of the local dispersion relation for the cooling flow in M87 and discusses the possible consequences of the results for a correct understanding of cooling flows.",2013-08-13,1987-08-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

The 1B flare, as observed in H alpha at Mees Solar Observatory, Maui, Hawaii, appeared as two sequential flares occurring at different neutral lines. The peaks of the time profile at 20 cm were delayed with respect to the 6 cm counterparts, but they were related to each other and to the H alpha activity. At 20 cm, precursor activity occurred, and an oppositely polarized source an arcminute away from the main burst may have triggered the flare. The main 20 cm emission appeared to be displaced limbward from the 6 cm burst. If both the 6 and 20 cm emission originated in the same system of loops, it is inferred that the apparent lateral displacement was caused by a height difference of 33,000 km in the sources of emission.",2013-08-13,1987-08-15,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870064902,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Low-loss offset feeds for electrically large symmetric dual-reflector antennas,"Circularly symmetric, dual reflector, high gain antenna systems often require feeds placed off the system's axis because of the need for multiple feeds to use the reflector antenna. Also, the constraint requiring the hyperboloid or shaped subreflector to remain circularly symmetric is sometimes added. In a Cassegrainian system, the subreflector and feed may be rotated off axis around the paraboloid focus and retain main reflector focusing. However, substantial spillover results in considerable noise with a high gain/low noise temperature system. In a shaped system, the tilt of the shaped subreflector and feed together results in substantial defocusing as well as spillover noise. If the subreflector is tilted approximately one-half the angle of the feed tilt in either the Casegrainian or the dual shaped reflector antenna, it is found that spillover and noise are substantially reduced with tolerable defocusing. An extensive numerical analysis of these effects was conducted to determine the characteristics of a planned 70-meter, dual shaped reflector versus Cassegrainian antenna and to gain some understanding of the cause of the observed effects.",2013-08-13,1987-07-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Potential advantages of this design include improved capability to burn non-standard fuels, short system length, and increased operating temperature range for advanced high performance engine cycles. After considerable development, key program emissons and performance goals were met with the variable geometry combustor. Primary development efforts were to evolve improved variable swirl cup configurations. In particular, air leakage through the variable area swirl cup had a strong effect on low power emissions and performance, while smoke level at high power was affected by features for improved mixing of the fuel and swirler air flow. Additional design and development is still needed to evolve a practical variable geometry combustor.",2013-08-13,1987-06-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870065177,ACOUSTICS,A new approach to the effect of sound on vortex dynamics,"Analytical results are presented on the effect of acoustic radiation on three-dimensional vortex motions in a homogeneous, slightly compressible, inviscid fluid. The flow is considered as linear and irrotational everywhere except inside a very thin cylindrical core region around the vortex filament. In the outside region, a velocity potential is introduced that must be multivalued, and it is shown how to compute this scalar potential if the motion of the vortex filament is prescribed. To find the motion of this singularity in an external potential flow, a variational principle involving a volume integral that must exclude the singular region is considered. A functional of the external potential and vortex filament position is obtained whose extrema give equations to determine the sought-after evolution. Thus, a generalization of the Biot-Savart law to flows with constant sound speed at low Mach number is obtained.",2013-08-13,1987-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870065187,PLASMA PHYSICS,Anode-type double layers in a nonuniform magnetic field,"The properties of strong, magnetized, three-dimensional double layers are studied. The double layers are produced by drawing a discharge to a large anode plate located in the diverging magnetic field region of a cylindrical argon discharge. If the anode voltage is sufficiently high, the electrons that are accelerated through the anode sheath may become sufficiently energetic to ionize the background neutral gas and transform the anode sheath into a strong double layer. The resulting conical-shaped structures, which extend outward from the plate, have parallel, oblique, and perpendicular electric field components with respect to the magnetic field. The axial extent of these structures depends on the plate bias voltage, neutral gas pressure, and the magnetic field. At neutral gas pressures of a few millitorr, the double-layer structures are visually apparent because of the enhanced light emission from neutrals excited by the energetic electrons. Color photographs of some of these structures are shown. The scaling of the width of these double layers with electric field components perpendicular to B is also investigated.",2013-08-13,1987-08-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Predicted performance parameters include detective and net quantum efficiencies, split-event probability, and a parameter characterizing the effective thickness presented by the detector to cosmic-ray protons. The predicted performance of two CCDs of different epitaxial layer thicknesses is compared.

19870065267,COMPUTER PROGRAMMING AND SOFTWARE,Increasing processor utilization during parallel computation rundown,"Some parallel processing environments provide for asynchronous execution and completion of general purpose parallel computations from a single computational phase. When all the computations from such a phase are complete, a new parallel computational phase is begun. Depending upon the granularity of the parallel computations to be performed, there may be a shortage of available work as a particular computational phase draws to a close (computational rundown). This can result in the waste of computing resources and the delay of the overall problem. In many practical instances, strict sequential ordering of phases of parallel computation is not totally required. In such cases, the beginning of one phase can be correctly computed before the end of a previous phase is completed. This allows additional work to be generated somewhat earlier to keep computing resources busy during each computational rundown. The conditions under which this can occur are identified and the frequency of occurrence of such overlapping in an actual parallel Navier-Stokes code is reported. A language construct is suggested and possible control strategies for the management of such computational phase overlapping are discsused.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870065448,CYBERNETICS,Shifting the closed-loop spectrum in the optimal linear quadratic regulator problem for hereditary systems,"In the optimal linear quadratic regulator problem for finite dimensional systems, the method known as an alpha-shift can be used to produce a closed-loop system whose spectrum lies to the left of some specified vertical line; that is, a closed-loop system with a prescribed degree of stability. This paper treats the extension of the alpha-shift to hereditary systems. As infinite dimensions, the shift can be accomplished by adding alpha times the identity to the open-loop semigroup generator and then solving an optimal regulator problem. However, this approach does not work with a new approximation scheme for hereditary control problems recently developed by Kappel and Salamon. Since this scheme is among the best to date for the numerical solution of the linear regulator problem for hereditary systems, an alternative method for shifting the closed-loop spectrum is needed. An alpha-shift technique that can be used with the Kappel-Salamon approximation scheme is developed. Both the continuous-time and discrete-time problems are considered. A numerical example which demonstrates the feasibility of the method is included.",2013-08-13,1987-09-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Such a memory stores n-tuple of + or - 1s. The components change depending on a hard-limited version of linear functions of all other components. With symmetric connections between components, a stable state is ultimately reached. By building up the connection matrix as a sum-of-outer products of m fundamental memories, it may be possible to recover a certain one of the m memories by using an initial n-tuple probe vector less than a Hamming distance n/2 away from the fundamental memory. If m fundamental memories are chosen at random, the maximum asymptotic value of m in order that most of the m original memories are exactly recoverable is n/(2 log n). With the added restriction that every one of the m fundamental memories be recoverable exactly, m can be no more than n/(4 log n) asymptotically as n approaches infinity. Extensions are also considered, in particular to capacity under quantization of the outer-product connection matrix. This quantized memory-capacity problem is closely related to the capacity of the quantized Gaussian channel.",2013-08-13,1987-07-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Parametric study results indicate that first-year and multiyear ice may be confused when first-year ice is very rough and has exceptionally high salinity, as well as being only a few degrees C from the melting point. Confusion also arises when multiyear ice is slightly more saline, the temperature is a few degrees C from the melting point, surface is moderately rough, and air bubbles are small but still typical of multiyear ice.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870065996,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Significance of agricultural row structure on the microwave emissivity of soils,A series of field experiments was carried out to extend the data base available for verifying agricultural row effect models of emissivity. The row effects model was used to simulate a data base from which an algorithm could be developed to account for row effects when the scene dielectric constant and small-scale roughness are unknown. One objective of the study was to quantify the significance of row structure and to develop a practical procedure for removing the effects of periodic row structure on the microwave emissivity of a soil in order to use the emissivity values to estimate the soil moisture. A second objective was to expand the data set available for model verification through field observations using a truck-mounted 1.4-GHz microwave radiometer.,2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870065999,COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR,Speckle noise reduction of 1-look SAR imagery,"Speckle noise is inherent to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Since the degradation of the image due to this noise results in uncertainties in the interpretation of the scene and in a loss of apparent resolution, it is desirable to filter the image to reduce this noise. In this paper, an adaptive algorithm based on the calculation of the local statistics around a pixel is applied to 1-look SAR imagery. The filter adapts to the nonstationarity of the image statistics since the size of the blocks is very small compared to that of the image. The performance of the filter is measured in terms of the equivalent number of looks (ENL) of the filtered image and the resulting resolution degradation. The results are compared to those obtained from different techniques applied to similar data. The local adaptive filter (LAF) significantly increases the ENL of the final image. The associated loss of resolution is also lower than that for other commonly used speckle reduction techniques.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870066003,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Estimation of X-band scattering properties of tree components,An X-band FM-CW very fine range resolution scatterometer was used to acquire backscattering data for a number of tree species. Using a model to describe the scattering source function and an experimental procedure for selected removal of plant parts allows the estimation of the volume backscatter coefficient and the volume extinction coefficient. It is found that: (1) leaves are strong attenuators as well as scatterers; (2) the albedo at a given angle of incidence is nearly independent of the tree type; (3) the tree limbs are good attenuators but rather poor scatterers; and (4) the albedo changes as a function of the angle of incidence and for deciduous trees is also a function of the season.,2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19870066078,NONMETALLIC MATERIALS,Structural ceramics in heat engines - The NASA viewpoint,"The interest of NASA in the application of ceramics in heat engines is reviewed. This interest started in the early 1950s with attempts to apply oxides, borides, and cermets as gas turbine components. These attempts, as other similar efforts around the world at that time, generally met with failure due to the brittle nature of the materials and a lack of understanding of how to accommodate brittleness by appropriate design approaches. More recent efforts of the 1970s have concentrated on the silicon nitride and silicon carbide family of ceramics. This class of materials demonstrated thermal stability and thermal shock resistance in gas turbine environments. Subsequent programs funded by the DOE and managed by NASA have demonstrated great strides in material fabricability and the application of FEM design concepts. However, the materials remain brittle and lacking in reliability and reproducibility. This reliability/reproducibility problem is viewed as the major current impediment to the application of ceramics in heat engines; approaches to its solution are discussed.",2013-08-13,1986-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Such a flow does not affect perturbations with wave vectors perpendicular to the flow. For perturbations with wave vectors parallel to the flow, the onset of morphological instability is somewhat suppressed and thermosolutal convection is greatly suppressed. When instabilities occur, they are oscillatory and correspond to travelling waves. For values of the crystal growth velocity for which mixed morphological and convective modes occur, the presence of a forced flow produces sufficient decoupling to allow otherwise degenerate branches to be identified.",2013-08-13,1984-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

19870066379,PLASMA PHYSICS,Turbulent MHD transport coefficients - An attempt at self-consistency,"In this paper, some multiple scale perturbation calculations of turbulent MHD transport coefficients begun in earlier papers are first completed. These generalize 'alpha effect' calculations by treating the velocity field and magnetic field on the same footing. Then the problem of rendering such calculations self-consistent is addressed, generalizing an eddy-viscosity hypothesis similar to that of Heisenberg for the Navier-Stokes case. The method also borrows from Kraichnan's direct interaction approximation. The output is a set of integral equations relating the spectra and the turbulent transport coefficients. Previous 'alpha effect' and 'beta effect' coefficients emerge as limiting cases. A treatment of the inertial range can also be given, consistent with a -5/3 energy spectrum power law. In the Navier-Stokes limit, a value of 1.72 is extracted for the Kolmogorov constant. Further applications to MHD are possible.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Due to the complex spectral characteristics of the wetland vegetation, it was necessary to implement several techniques in the classification of the MSS imagery of the Steel Creek Delta. In particular, when performing unsupervised classification, an iterative cluster busting technique was used which simplified the cluster labeling process.

The Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer counting errors due to data transfer losses and coincidence losses were analyzed for data input rates from 10 samples/sec to 70,000 samples/sec. Coincidence losses were calculated by determining the Poisson probability of having more than one event occurring during the droplet signal time. The magnitude of the coincidence loss can be determined, and for less than a 15 percent loss, corrections can be made. The data transfer losses were estimated for representative data transfer rates.

A first-generation data analysis algorithm which combines a priori information with current geodetic measurements was proposed. Relevant methods which can be used in the algorithm were discussed. Prior information is the unifying feature of this algorithm. Some of the problems which may arise through the use of a priori information in the analysis were indicated and preventive measures were demonstrated. The first step in the algorithm is the optimal design of deformation networks. The second step in the algorithm identifies the descriptive model of the deformation field. The final step in the algorithm is the improved estimation of deformation parameters. Although deformation parameters are estimated in the process of model discrimination, they can further be improved by the use of a priori information about them. According to the proposed algorithm this information must first be tested against the estimates calculated using the sample data only. Null-hypothesis testing procedures were developed for this purpose. Six different estimators which employ a priori information were examined. Emphasis was put on the case when the prior information is wrong and analytical expressions for possible improvements under incompatible prior information were derived.",2013-09-05,1987-10-01,/api/citations/19880002821/downloads/19880002821.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Experimental data indicates that these rates are different from those recorded for plants grown in open field agriculture, or in open growth chambers. Since higher plants are a crucial component of a controlled ecological life support system (CELSS), it is important that the consequences of these rate differences be understood with regard to the growth and yield of the plants.

Mapping a simulation onto a message-passing architecture is especially difficult when the computational workload dynamically changes as a function of time and space; this is exactly the situation faced by battlefield simulations. This paper studies an approach where the simulated battlefield domain is first partitioned into many regions of equal size; typically there are more regions than processors. The regions are then assigned to processors; a processor is responsible for performing all simulation activity associated with the regions. The assignment algorithm is quite simple and attempts to balance load by exploiting locality of workload intensity. The performance of this technique is studied on a simple battlefield simulation implemented on the Flex/32 multiprocessor. Measurements show that the proposed method achieves reasonable processor efficiencies. Furthermore, the method shows promise for use in dynamic remapping of the simulation.",2013-09-05,1987-10-01,/api/citations/19880002905/downloads/19880002905.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Emphasis is on downwind data, but some upwind measurements taken during the 1985 experiment are also considered. General ray theory for a moving medium is reviewed and ray equations obtained. Restrictions are introduced simplifying the equations and permitting the use of a ray theory program MEDUSA, the computed propagation loss curve of which is compared to the measurements. Good qualitative agreement is obtained with 1984 downwind data. The results indicate that the downwind sound field is that of a near-ground sound channel. Although more scatter is seen in the 1985 data, agreement between theory and data is also good. In particular, the position and magnitude of the jump in the sound levels associated with the beginning of the sound channel is correctly predicted. The theoretical explanation of the upwind data is less successful. Ray theory calculations indicate the formation of a shadow zone that, in fact, does not occur. While no sharp shadow zone is apparent in the data, the general expectation (based on ray theory) that sound levels should be much reduced upwind is confirmed by the data.",2013-09-05,1987-07-01,/api/citations/19880002967/downloads/19880002967.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The data indicated that planform has a small effect on the zero lift drag of a multibody configuration. The longitudinal data obtained at lifting conditions showed a sensitivity to planform shape. Lateral-directional data obtained for all configurations did not uncover any unusual stability traits for this class of configuration. A comparison study was also made between the planform effects observed on single-body and multibody configurations. Results from this study indicate that the multibody concept appears to offer a mechanism for employing a low-sweep wing with no significant increase in zero-lift drag but still retaining high-performance characteristics at high-lift conditions.

19880003091,AIR TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY,Experimental evidence for modifying the current physical model for ice accretion on aircraft surfaces,"Closeup movies, still photographs, and other experimental data suggest that the current physical model for ice accretion needs significant modification. At aircraft airspeeds there was no flow of liquid over the surface of the ice after a short initial flow, even at barely subfreezing temperatures. Instead, there were very large stationary drops on the ice surface that lose water from their bottoms by freezing and replenish their liquid by catching the microscopic cloud droplets. This observation disagrees with the existing physical model, which assumes there is a thin liquid film continuously flowing over the ice surface. With no such flow, the freezing-fraction concept of the model fails when a mass balance is performed on the surface water. Rime ice does, as the model predicts, form when the air temperature is low enough to cause the cloud droplets to freeze almost immediately on impact. However, the characteristic shapes of horn-glaze ice or rime ice are primarily caused by the ice shape affecting the airflow locally and consequently the droplet catch and the resulting ice shape. Ice roughness greatly increases the heat transfer coefficient, stops the movement of drops along the surface, and may also affect the airflow initially and thereby the droplet catch. At high subreezing temperatures the initial flow and shedding of surface drops have a large effect on the ice shape. At the incipient freezing limit, no ice forms.",2013-09-05,1986-01-01,/api/citations/19880003091/downloads/19880003091.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Eleven percent oxygen should prevent most types of fires, since 15 percent oxygen retards the combustion of paper and 13 percent oxygen extinguishes pentane flames. Test results indicate that seated humans can perform mental tasks in atmospheres containing 11.5 percent oxygen.

We are conducting a study to assess the systems aspects of inertial fusion as applied to such missions, based on the conceptual engine design of Hyde (1983) we describe the required systems for an entirely new spacecraft design called VISTA that is based on the use of DT fuel.

19880003167,COMPOSITE MATERIALS,Interfacial strength development in thermoplastic resins and fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites,"An experimental program to develop test methods to be used to characterize interfacial (autohesive) strength development in polysulfone thermoplastic resin and graphite-polysulfone prepreg during processing is reported. Two test methods were used to examine interfacial strength development in neat resin samples. These included an interfacial tension test and a compact tension (CT) fracture toughness test. The interfacial tensile test proved to be very difficult to perform with a considerable amount of data scatter. Thus, the interfacial test was discarded in favor of the fracture toughness test. Interfacial strength development was observed by measuring the refracture toughness of precracked compact tension specimens that were rehealed at a given temperature and contact time. The measured refracture toughness was correlated with temperature and contact time. Interfacial strength development in graphite-polysulfone unidirectional composites was measured using a double cantilever beam (DCB) interlaminar fracture toughness test. The critical strain energy release rate of refractured composite specimens was measured as a function of healing temperature and contact time.",2013-09-05,1987-09-01,/api/citations/19880003167/downloads/19880003167.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880003237,MATERIALS PROCESSING,Microgravity nucleation and particle coagulation experiments support,"A hollow sphere model is developed to predict the range of supersaturation ratio values for refractory metal vapors in a proposed experimental nucleation apparatus. Since the experiments are to be carried out in a microgravity environment, the model neglects the effects of convection and assumes that the only transfer of vapors through an inert gas atmosphere is by conduction and molecular diffusion. A consistent set of physical properties data is assembled for the various candidate metals and inert ambient gases expected to be used in the nucleation experiments. Transient partial pressure profiles are computed for the diffusing refractory species for two possible temperature distributions. The supersaturation ratio values from both candidate temperature profiles are compared with previously obtained experimetnal data on a silver-hydrogen system. The model is used to simulate the diffusion of magnesium vapor through argon and other inert gas atmospheres over ranges of initial and boundary conditions. These results identify different combinations of design and operating parameters which are liekly to produce supersaturation ratio values high enough to induce homogeneous nucleation in the apparatus being designed for the microgravity nucleation experiments.",2013-09-05,1987-12-01,/api/citations/19880003237/downloads/19880003237.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880003298,ASTRODYNAMICS,A demonstration of high precision GPS orbit determination for geodetic applications,"High precision orbit determination of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites is a key requirement for GPS-based precise geodetic measurements and precise low-earth orbiter tracking, currently under study at JPL. Different strategies for orbit determination have been explored at JPL with data from a 1985 GPS field experiment. The most successful strategy uses multi-day arcs for orbit determination and includes fine tuning of spacecraft solar pressure coefficients and station zenith tropospheric delays using the GPS data. Average rms orbit repeatability values for 5 of the GPS satellites are 1.0, 1.2, and 1.7 m in altitude, cross-track, and down-track componenets when two independent 5-day fits are compared. Orbit predictions up to 24 hours outside the multi-day arcs agree within 4 m of independent solutions obtained with well tracked satellites in the prediction interval. Baseline repeatability improves with multi-day as compared to single-day arc orbit solutions. When tropospheric delay fluctuations are modeled with process noise, significant additional improvement in baseline repeatability is achieved. For a 246-km baseline, with 6-day arc solutions for GPS orbits, baseline repeatability is 2 parts in 100 million (0.4-0.6 cm) for east, north, and length components and 8 parts in 100 million for the vertical component. For 1314 and 1509 km baselines with the same orbits, baseline repeatability is 2 parts in 100 million for the north components (2-3 cm) and 4 parts in 100 million or better for east, length, and vertical components.",2013-09-05,1987-11-15,/api/citations/19880003298/downloads/19880003298.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A soft-decision decoding for this class of codes is devised. Some specific short codes for Quad Phase Shift Key (QPSK), 8-PSK and 16-PSK modulations are constructed. These codes have good minimum squared Euclidean distances and provide 2 to 5.8 dB coding gains over uncoded QPSK modulation without (or with little) bandwidth expansion. The complete weight distributions of these specific codes are determined. Based on these weight distributions, their error probabilities are evaluated. Some of these codes have simple trellis structures and hence can be decoded by Viterbi decoding algorithm with relatively simple implementation. Moreover, the codes are very suitable for use as inner codes for various cascaded coding schemes with Reed-Solomon codes as outer codes.",2013-09-05,1987-12-31,/api/citations/19880003330/downloads/19880003330.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In the model, the effect of the ratio of the production rate to the dissipation rate on eddy viscosity is modeled by use of the multiple-time-scales and a variable partitioning of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. The concept of a variable partitioning of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum and the rest of the model details are based on the previously reported algebraic stress turbulence model. Example problems considered include: a fully developed channel flow, a plane jet exhausting into a moving stream, a wall jet flow, and a weakly coupled wake-boundary layer interaction flow. The computational results compared favorably with those obtained by using the algebraic stress turbulence model as well as experimental data. The present turbulence model, as well as the algebraic stress turbulence model, yielded significantly improved computational results for the complex turbulent boundary layer flows, such as the wall jet flow and the wake boundary layer interaction flow, compared with available computational results obtained by using the standard kappa-epsilon turbulence model.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880003372/downloads/19880003372.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

After considering some basic synchronization mechanisms, a collection of barrier algorithms with either linear or logarithmic depth are presented. A graphical model is described that profiles the execution of the barriers and other parallel programming constructs. This model shows how the interaction between the barrier algorithms and the work that they synchronize can impact their performance. One result is that logarithmic tree structured barriers show good performance when synchronizing fixed length work, while linear self-scheduled barriers show better performance when synchronizing fixed length work with an imbedded critical section. The linear barriers are better able to exploit the process skew associated with critical sections. Timing experiments, performed on an eighteen processor Flex/32 shared memory multiprocessor, that support these conclusions are detailed.",2013-09-05,1987-09-01,/api/citations/19880003552/downloads/19880003552.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

This requires a strong testing program to estimate the reliability, since neither formal methods, software engineering nor fault tolerant methods can guarantee perfection. Prior to the final testing software goes through a debugging period and many models have been developed to try to estimate reliability from the debugging data. However, the existing models are poorly validated and often give poor performance. This paper emphasizes the fact that part of their failures can be attributed to the random nature of the debugging data given to these models as input, and it poses the problem of correcting this defect as an area of future research.",2013-09-05,1987-12-01,/api/citations/19880003570/downloads/19880003570.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19880003618,SYSTEMS ANALYSIS,On the next generation of reliability analysis tools,"The current generation of reliability analysis tools concentrates on improving the efficiency of the description and solution of the fault-handling processes and providing a solution algorithm for the full system model. The tools have improved user efficiency in these areas to the extent that the problem of constructing the fault-occurrence model is now the major analysis bottleneck. For the next generation of reliability tools, it is proposed that techniques be developed to improve the efficiency of the fault-occurrence model generation and input. Further, the goal is to provide an environment permitting a user to provide a top-down design description of the system from which a Markov reliability model is automatically constructed. Thus, the user is relieved of the tedious and error-prone process of model construction, permitting an efficient exploration of the design space, and an independent validation of the system's operation is obtained. An additional benefit of automating the model construction process is the opportunity to reduce the specialized knowledge required. Hence, the user need only be an expert in the system he is analyzing; the expertise in reliability analysis techniques is supplied.",2013-09-05,1987-10-01,/api/citations/19880003618/downloads/19880003618.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Theoretical analysis of composite materials indicates that the modulus of the material must decrease as impact damage increases. This decrease must also correlate to the decrease in residual strength. This study attempts to verify these hypotheses. Graphite/epoxy laminates (AS4/3501-6) of various fiber orientations (8 (0 deg), 2 (+ or - 45 deg)sub 8) were impacted using a falling weight impact tester. Impact energies ranged from 0.42 to 1.55 ft-lb, with impact velocities from 2.03 to 3.98 ft/sec. The results show that there is a reduction in residual modulus of the plate as the impact energy increases.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006225/downloads/19880006225.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The technique is analytic in the sense that explicit solutions to the Lagrange planetary equations are given; consequently, no numerical integrations are required in the solution process. The atmospheric density in the technique described is represented by a rotating spherical exponential model with superposed effects of the oblate atmosphere and the diurnal variations. A computer program implementing the process is discussed and sample output is compared with output from program NSEP (Numerical Satellite Ephemeris Program). NSEP uses a numerical integration technique to account for atmospheric drag effects.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006226/downloads/19880006226.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The first flight of FES was in 1985. FES uses an optical system to take holograms of the growing crystal to be analyzed after the mission in the Holography Ground System (HGS) located in the Test Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center. Microscopic observation of the images formed by the reconstructed holograms is critical to determining crystal growth rate and particle velocity. FES and HGS were designed for a resolution of better than 20 micrometers, but initial observation of the flight holograms show a limit of 80 micrometers. The resolution of the FES holograms is investigated, as well as the role of beam intensity ratio and exposure time on the resolution of HGS produced holograms.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006227/downloads/19880006227.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

To decrease this human involvement, as well as to protect and most efficiently utilize this important resource, NASA has undertaken major efforts to promote progress in the design and development of autonomously managed power systems. Two areas being actively pursued are autonomous power system (APS) breadboards and knowledge-based expert system (KBES) applications. The former are viewed as a requirement for the timely development of the latter. Not only will they serve as final testbeds for the various KBES applications, but will play a major role in the knowledge engineering phase of their development. The current power system breadboard designs are of a distributed microprocessor nature. The distributed nature, plus the need to connect various external computer capabilities (i.e., conventional host computers and symbolic processors), places major emphasis on effective networking. The communications and networking technologies for the first power system breadboard/test facility are described.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006233/downloads/19880006233.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The objective of this research is to improve the handling of the screening by going beyond the current first Born approximation. Much of this work is directly related to the alloy semiconductor Hg sub 1-xCd sub xTe which is important for infrared detectors and is a good candidate for microgravity crystal growth. The principal conclusion, so far, is that the major difficulty is probably the treatment of short range screening at higher temperatures.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006245/downloads/19880006245.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880006251,NONMETALLIC MATERIALS,The development of test methodology for testing glassy materials,"The inherent brittleness of glass invariably leads to a large variability in strength data and a time dependence in strength (i.e., static fatigue). Loading rate plays a large role in strength values. Glass is found to be weaker when supporting loads over long periods as compared to glass which undergoes rapid loading. In this instance the purpose of rapid loading is to fail the glass before any significant crack growth occurs. However, a decrease in strength occurs with a decrease in loading rate, pursuant to substantial crack extension. These properties complicate the structural design allowable for the utilization of glass components in applications such as mirrors for the Space Telescope and AXAF for Spacelab and the space station.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006251/downloads/19880006251.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The circumferential locations of separation are taken from experimental data. Based on a slender body theory, the resulting simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations in a cross-flow plane are solved with Broyden's modified Newton-Raphson method. Total force coefficients are obtained through momentum principle with new expressions for nonconical flow. It is shown through the method of function deflation that multiple solutions exist at large enough angles of attack, even with symmetric separation points. These additional solutions are asymmetric in vortex separation and produce side force coefficients which agree well with data for cones and tangent ogives.",2013-09-05,1988-02-01,/api/citations/19880006386/downloads/19880006386.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Experimental and code development research is being performed at Lewis to better understand chemical reacting flows with the long term goal of establishing these reliable computer codes. The approach to understanding chemical reacting flows is to look at separate simple parts of this complex phenomena as well as to study the full turbulent reacting flow process. As a result research on the fluid mechanics associated with chemical reacting flows was initiated. The chemistry of fuel-air combustion is also being studied.

Supporting analysis of the inlet using a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code (PEPSIS) indicates that sidewall shock/boundary layer interactions cause large separated regions in the corners underneath the cowl. Such separations generally lead to inlet unstart, and are thus a major concern. As a result of the analysis, additional bleed regions were added to the inlet model sidewalls and cowl to control separations in the corners. A two-dimensional analysis incorporating bleed on the ramp is also presented. Supporting experiments for the Mach 5 programs were conducted in the Lewis' 1 x 1 SWT. A small-scale model representing the inlet geometry up to the ramp shoulder and cowl lip was tested to verify the accelerator plate test technique and to obtain data on flow migration in the ramp and sidewall boundary layers. Another study explored several ramp bleed configurations to control boundary layer separations in that region. Design of a two-dimensional Mach 5 cruise inlet represents several major challenges including multimode operation and dual flow, high temperatures, and three-dimensional airflow effects.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880006429/downloads/19880006429.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A variety of inlet concepts were explored and characterized. The emphasis of the inlet program was the development of the short (light weight), fixed geometry, side-wall-compression inlets that operate efficiently over a wide Mach number range. As hypersonic combustion tunnels were developed, programs to study the parameters controlling fuel mixing and combustion with single and multiple strut models were conducted using direct connect test techniques. These various tests supported the design of subscale engine test hardware that integrated inlet and combustor technology and allowed the study of the effect of heat release on thrust and combustor/inlet interaction.

The reactions contained in the mechanism reflect the current state of knowledge of the chemistry of the hydrogen/air system, and the assigned rate coefficients are consistent with accepted values. It was determined that the mechanism is capable of satisfactorily reproducing the experimental results for a range of conditions relevant to scramjet combustion. Calculations made with the reaction mechanism for representative scramjet combustor conditions at Mach 8, 16, and 25 showed that chemical kinetic effects can be important and that combustor models which use nonequilibrium chemistry should be used in preference to models that assume equilibrium chemistry. For the conditions examined the results also showed the importance of including the HO2 chemistry in the mechanism. For Mach numbers less than 16, the studies suggest that an ignition source will most likely be required to overcome slow ignition chemistry. At Mach 25, the initial temperature and pressure was high enough that ignition was rapid and the presence of an ignition source did not significantly affect reaction rates.",2013-09-05,1988-02-01,/api/citations/19880006464/downloads/19880006464.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The electrochemical reactions of an artificial fecal waste mixture was examined. Waste electrolysis experiments were performed in a single compartment reactor, on platinum electrodes, to determine conditions likely to maximize the efficiency of oxidation of fecal waste material to CO2. The maximum current efficiencies for artificial fecal waste electrolysis to CO2 was found to be around 50 percent in the test apparatus. Experiments involving fecal waste oxidation on platinum indicates that electrodes with a higher overvoltage for oxygen evolution such as lead dioxide will give a larger effective potential range for organic oxidation reactions. An electrochemical packed column reactor was constructed with lead dioxide as electrode material. Preliminary experiments were performed using a packed-bed reactor and continuous flow techniques showing this system may be effective in complete oxidation of fecal material. The addition of redox mediator Ce(3+)/Ce(4+) enhances the oxidation process of biomass components.

The methods include classical lamination theory using time increments, direction solution of the Volterra Integral, Zienkiewicz's linear Prony series method, and a new method called Nonlinear Differential Equation Method (NDEM) which uses a nonlinear Prony series. The criteria used for comparison of the various methods include the stability of the solution technique, time step size stability, computer solution time length, and computer memory storage. The Volterra Integral allowed the implementation of higher order solution techniques but had difficulties solving singular and weakly singular compliance function. The Zienkiewicz solution technique, which requires the viscoelastic response to be modeled by a Prony series, works well for linear viscoelastic isotropic materials and small time steps.

First, known symmetries of anisotropic panels are exploited in the selection of approximation functions. Second, a reduced basis technique based on these same symmetries is applied in the linear range. Finally, geometric boundary conditions are enforced via an exterior penalty function approach, rather than relying on choice of approximation functions to satisfy these boundary conditions. Numerical results are presented for both the linear and nonlinear range, with additional studies made to determine the effect of variation in penalty parameter and number of basis vectors. In the second part, six panels possessing anisotropy and bending-extensional coupling are tested.

The NASA DARPA Sikorsky RSRA X-wing program developed flightworthy X-wing hardware. All design activity and the majority of its component fabrication is completed.

19880008223,AERODYNAMICS,Fixed wing CCW aerodynamics with and without supplementary thrust deflection,The concept of circulation control was successfully demonstrated in flight using an A-6 aircraft. Circulation control can provide an aircraft with STOL performance of heavy lift capability. For ship based Naval aircraft the lower takeoff and landing velocities result in reduced deck gear and wind over the deck requirements. Circulation control airfoils can be mechanically less complex and lightweight compared to multi-element high lift airfoils.,2013-09-05,1987-05-01,/api/citations/19880008223/downloads/19880008223.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19880008226,AERODYNAMICS,Circulation control STOL aircraft design aspects,"Since Davidson patented Circulation Control Airfoils in 1960, there have been only 2 aircraft designed and flown with circulation control (CC). Designing with CC is complex for the following reasons: the relation between lift increase and blowing momentum is nonlinear; for good cruise performance one must change the wing geometry in flight from a round to a sharp trailing edge. The bleed air from the propulsion engines or an auxiliary compressor, must be used efficiently. In designing with CC, the propulsion and control aspects are just as important as aerodynamics. These design aspects were examined and linearized equations are presented in order to facilitate a preliminary analysis of the performance potential of CC. The thrust and lift requirements for takeoff make the calculated runway length very sensitive to the bleed air ratio. Thrust vectoring improves performance and can offset nose down pitching moments. The choice of blowing jet to free stream velocity ratio determines the efficiency of applying bleed air power.",2013-09-05,1987-05-01,/api/citations/19880008226/downloads/19880008226.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

When activity beyond the band is attenuated because of other considerations, this trade-off may be used to improve the performance within the band. Specifically, transport delay in computer-generated imagery systems is reduced to a manageable problem by recognizing frequency limits in vehicle activity and manual-control capacity. Based on these limits, a compensation algorithm has been developed for use in aircraft simulation at NASA Ames Research Center. For direct measurement of transport delays, a beam-splitter experiment is presented that accounts for the complete flight simulation environment. Values determined by this experiment are appropriate for use in the compensation algorithm. The algorithm extends the bandwidth of high-frequency flight simulation to well beyond that of normal pilot inputs. Within this bandwidth, the visual scene presentation manifests negligible gain distortion and phase lag. After a year of utilization, two minor exceptions to universal simulation applicability have been identified and subsequently resolved.",2013-09-05,1988-01-01,/api/citations/19880008261/downloads/19880008261.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In this example the flutter mode is sensitive to changes in dynamic pressure and eigenspace methods are used to enhance the performance of a stabilizing minimum energy/linear quadratic regulator controller and associated observer.

The resistojet heater was supplied with power at 20 kHz and low voltage through a power controller. The resistojet was isolated from its power supply in the RFI enclosure, and the magnetic emission measured at three locations around the resistojet at various heater currents. At a heater current of 18.5 A the maximum magnetic emission was 61 dBpt at a distance of 1 m from the resistojet and at a location at the rear of the thruster. Calculations indicate that the case and heat shields provided a minimum of 4 dB of attenuation at a current of 18.5 A. Maximum radiation was measured at the rear of the resistojet along its major axis and was thought to be due to the magnetic radiation from the power leads. At a distance of 37 cm from the resistojet the maximum magnetic radiation measured was 73 dBpt at a current of 11.2 A. The power input leads were also a source of magnetic radiation.

A model that can be employed in the design of meteoroid and space debris protection systems for space structures is developed. The model consists of equations that relate crater and perforation damage of a multisheet structure to parameters such as projectile size, impact velocity, and trajectory obliquity. The equations are obtained through a regression analysis of oblique hypervelocity impact test data. This data shows that the response of a multisheet structure to oblique impact is significantly different from its response to normal hypervelocity impact. It was found that obliquely incident projectiles produce ricochet debris that can severely damage panels or instrumentation located on the exterior of a space structure. Obliquity effects of high-speed impact must, therefore, be considered in the design of any structure exposed to the meteoroid and space debris environment.",2013-09-05,1988-02-01,/api/citations/19880008620/downloads/19880008620.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The desire to provide software which allows the user to choose between the often conflicting goals of minimizing central processing unit (CPU) time or storage requirements has led to a diagonal-based algorithm in which one of four types of storage is selected for each diagonal. The candidate storage types employed were chosen to be efficient on the CYBER 205 for diagonals which have nonzero structure which is dense, moderately sparse, very sparse and short, or very sparse and long; however, for many densities, no diagonal type is most efficient with respect to both resource requirements, and a trade-off must be made. For each diagonal, an initialization subroutine estimates the CPU time and storage required for each storage type based on results from previously performed numerical experimentation. These requirements are adjusted by weights provided by the user which reflect the relative importance the user places on the two resources.

The major objective is to create a very friendly environment for engineers to design, maintain and verify their model and also automatically convert the mathematical model into FORTRAN code for conventional computation. A demonstration program was designed for modeling the Space Shuttle Main Engine simulation mathematical model called Propulsion System Automatic Modeling (PSAM). PSAM provides a very friendly and well organized environment for engineers to build a knowledge base for base equations and general information. PSAM contains an initial set of component process elements for the Space Shuttle Main Engine simulation and a questionnaire that allows the engineer to answer a set of questions to specify a particular model. PSAM is then able to automatically generate the model and the FORTRAN code. A future goal is to download the FORTRAN code to the VAX/VMS system for conventional computation.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880007020/downloads/19880007020.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

This is shown to be due, at least in part, to the low-valued effective branching factor that is a characteristic of problems with real-valued cost functions. The semi-optimal, epsilon-admissible IDA asterisk sub epsilon search algorithm that the authors described was shown to open fewer nodes than both A asterisk and IDA asterisk with storage complexity proportional to the depth of the search tree.",2013-09-05,1987-11-01,/api/citations/19880007028/downloads/19880007028.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19880007144,OPTICS,BE Ursae Majoris: A detached binary with a unique reprocessing spectrum,"New infrared photometry, optical and UV spectrophotometry, and a photographic ephemeris are presented for the detached binary BE UMa. Results show the primary to be a DO white dwarf with an effective temperature of 80,000 + or - 15,000 K and a mass of 0.6 + or - 0.1 solar masses. No evidence is found for variability of the primary. The main sequence secondary star is shown to be of early M spectral type, with a formal range of M1 to M5 being possible. A reflection effect in reprocessed line and continuum radiation is produced by EUV radiation from the primary incident on the secondary atmosphere. It is suggested that the temperature of the reprocessed component of the secondary's atmosphere is in the 5000 to 8500 K range, and that emission lines of decreasing ionization form deeper in the irradiated envelope. Relatively narrow He II and high excitation metal lines are formed from recombination and continuum fluorescence processes.",2013-09-05,1987-09-01,/api/citations/19880007144/downloads/19880007144.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19880007246,"AIRCRAFT DESIGN, TESTING AND PERFORMANCE",A review of research in rotor loads,"The research accomplished in the area of rotor loads over the last 13 to 14 years is reviewed. The start of the period examined is defined by the 1973 AGARD Milan conference and the 1974 hypothetical rotor comparison. The major emphasis of the review is research performed by the U.S. Army and NASA at their laboratories and/or by the industry under government contract. For the purpose of this review, two main topics are addressed: rotor loads prediction and means of rotor loads reduction. A limited discussion of research in gust loads and maneuver loads is included. In the area of rotor loads predictions, the major problem areas are reviewed including dynamic stall, wake induced flows, blade tip effects, fuselage induced effects, blade structural modeling, hub impedance, and solution methods. It is concluded that the capability to predict rotor loads has not significantly improved in this time frame. Future progress will require more extensive correlation of measurements and predictions to better understand the causes of the problems, and a recognition that differences between theory and measurement have multiple sources, yet must be treated as a whole. There is a need for high-quality data to support future research in rotor loads, but the resulting data base must not be seen as an end in itself. It will be useful only if it is integrated into firm long-range plans for the use of the data.",2013-09-05,1988-02-01,/api/citations/19880007246/downloads/19880007246.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In such models, the scale perpendicular to the plane has a strong effect in determining the distribution of cosmic rays. Radial distributions were calculated for cylindrical coordinate models. The implied gamma-ray longitude distributions were then calculated and compared with the SAS-2 data. Assuming the sources to be supernova remnants or pulsars, only cosmic-ray nucleon halo models with an upper limit scale height of about 3 kpc provide a good fit to the gamma ray data. Consideration of the gamma-ray latitude data gives a half thickness of 2 + or - 2 kpc for the cosmic ray electron halo.",2013-08-09,1977-07-01,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

For energies above 100 MeV the gamma ray results are consistent with an equation of the form I(b)=C1+C2/sin b with the second term being dominant, suggesting that the radiation above 100 MeV comes largely from the local regions of the galactic disk. Between 35 and 100 MeV, a similar equation is also a reasonable representation of the data, but here the two terms are comparable, with the first, or isotropic term, actually being the larger one. In addition to indicating that the diffuse radiation is partially galactic, these results imply a steepness for the energy spectrum of the diffuse isotropic component which places significant constraints on possible theoretical models of this radiation.",2013-08-09,1977-07-01,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

In the context of an open universe model, the value of omega which best fits the present gamma-ray data is omega equals approx. 0.1 which does not conflict with upper limits on Comptonization distortion of the 3K background radiation.

Flap configurations of the generator that shed multiple vortices were found to have wakes that dispersed by vortex merging and sinusoidal instability. Reductions of approximately 50 percent in both the wake rolling moment imposed on a following aircraft and the aircraft separation requirement were achieved in the ground based and flight test experiments by deflecting the trailing edge flaps more inboard than outboard. Significantly, this configuration did not increase the drag or vibration on the generating aircraft compared to the conventional landing configuration. Ground based results of rolling moment measurement and flow visualization are shown, using a water tow facility, an air tow facility, and a wind tunnel. Flight test results are also shown, using a full scale B-747 airplane.

The LANDSAT areas were compared with low altitude measurements. The average accuracy over all the mined land sample areas mapped from LANDSAT-1 was 90%. The discrimination of strip mine subcategories is somewhat limited on LANDSAT imagery. A mine site, whether active or inactive, can be inferred by lack of vegetation, by shape, or image texture. Mine ponds are difficult or impossible to detect because of their small size and turbidity. Unless bordered and contrasted with vegetation, haulage roads are impossible to delineate. Preparation plants and refuge areas are not detectable. Density slicing of LANDSAT band 7 proved most useful in the detection of reclamation progress within the mined areas.

It was also shown that at the level of the ozone maximum the ozone partial pressure has a pronounced period of about 26 months. Total ozone and the ozone concentration in the different layers have marginally significant (at plus or minus sigma) correlations with relative sunspot number. The time lag for these correlations is long in the troposphere (about 36 months) but decreases with height to the level of ozone maximum (to about 2 months).

In the suite of low-KREEP highland rocks, Fe/(Fe + Mg) in the normative mafic minerals increases and the albite content of normative plagio-clase decreases as the total amount of normative plagioclase increases, the opposite of the trend predicted by the Bowen reaction principle. The distribution of compositions of rocks from terrestrial layered mafic intrusives is substantially different: here the analyses fall in several discrete clusters (anorthositic rocks, norites, granophyres and ferrogabbros, ultramafics), and the chemical trends noted above are not reproduced. It is suggested that the observed trends in lunar highland rocks could be produced by crystal fractionation in a deep global surface magma system if (1) plagiociase tended to float, upon crystallization, and (2) the magma was kept agitated and well mixed (probably by thermal convection) until crystallization was far advanced and relatively little residual liquid was left.

The higher concentrations of Ce, Sc, Sc, Ba, La, Co, Sr, and Zr in zone 2001 may be connected with the presence in this zone of a basaltic rock type seldom seen in the other zones. That is, about half of the basaltic fragments in the large size fractions in zone 2001 are of a specific porphyritic breccia-like type. Anorthositic fragments containing a notable amount of metallic iron are basically limited to zone 2004 and probably explain the lower concentrations of Ce, Rb, Ba, La, and perhaps Co in this zone. The high concentrations of Ag and Ce found previously are confirmed. Although Ag is at nearly the same concentration in all four zones of the core, Cd in the core is the result of local enrichment.

Emphasis is given to methodical problems and the geological interpretation of lunar rock ages. Often it is ambigious to associate a given lunar breccia with a certain formation, or a formation with a basin. In addition, large-scale events on the Moon have not necessarily reset radiometric clocks completely. One rock fragment has a well-defined plateau age of 4.28 b.y., but the ages of two Apollo 17 breccias define an upper limit for the formation age of the Serenitatis basin at 4.05 b.y. Ages derived from five mare basalts indicate cessation of mare volcanism at Taurus-Littrow approximately 3.78 b.y. ago. Ca/Ar-37 exposure ages show that Camelot Crater was formed by an impact approximately 95 m.y. ago. After a short summary of the lunar timetable as it stands at the end of the Apollo program, we report about Ar-39/Ar-40 and rare gas studies on the Malvern meteorite. This achondrite resembles lunar highland breccias in texture as well as in rare-gas patterns. It was strongly annealed at some time between 3.4 and 3.8 b.y. ago. The results indicate that very similar processes have occurred on the Moon and on achondritic parent bodies at comparable times, leading to impact breccias with strikingly similar features, including the retention of rare-gas isotopes from various sources.",2013-08-09,1977-01-01,/api/citations/19780005017/downloads/19780005017.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780005015

The production size frequency distribution for lunar craters in the crater size range from approximately 1 nu to several millimeters in diameter is derived from various microcrater measurements within a factor of up to 5. Particle track exposure age measurements for a variety of lunar samples have been performed. They allow the conversion of the lunar crater size frequency production distributions into particle fluxes. The development of crater populations on lunar rocks under self-destruction by subsequent meteoroid impacts and crater overlap is discussed and theoretically described. Erosion rates on lunar rocks on the order of several millimeters per 10 yr are calculated.

Several areas in the mare and highland regions were studied. The albedos of various surface objects were obtained.

The results suggest that the Ca-Al-rich inclusions Allende and other carbonaceous chondrites are aggregates of the highest temperature condensates. Complete condensation of these elements is followed, 100 deg later, by the onset of the crystallization of nickel-iron, forsterite and enstatite. Transport of Ca-Al-rich refractory condensates from one part of the nebula to another before the condensation of these lower-temperature phases may have been responsible for the refractory element fractionations between the different classes of chondrites and possibly for the inferred refractory element enrichment of the Moon. The temperature gap between the condensation temperatures of nickel-iron and forsterite increases with increasing total pressure. Because pressure and temperature probably increased with decreasing heliocentric distance in the solar nebula, Mercury may have accreted from a condensate assemblage having a higher metal/silicate ratio than Venus or Earth which may, in turn, have formed from less oxidized material than Mars.",2013-08-09,1977-07-01,/api/citations/19780005035/downloads/19780005035.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780005015

Thermodynamic calculations show that Ca-, Al-, and Ti-rich compounds condense first in a cooling nebula. The initial high temperature mineralogy is gehlenite, spinel, perovskite, Ca-Al-rich pyroxenes, and anorthite. Inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites such as the Allende meteorite are composed primarily of these minerals and, in addition, are highly enriched in refractories such as REE relative to carbonaceous chondrites. These inclusions can yield basalt and anorthosite in the proportions required to eliminate the europium anomaly, leaving a residual spinel-melilite interior. A deep interior high in Ca-Al does not imply an unacceptable mean density or moment of inertia for the Moon. The inferred high-U content of the lunar interior, both from the Allende analog and the high heat flow, indicates a high-temperature interior. The model is consistent with extensive early melting, with shallow melting at 3 AE, and with presently high deep internal temperatures. It is predicted that the outer 250 km is rich in plagioclase and FeO. The low iron content of the interior in this model raises the interior temperatures estimated from electrical conductivity by some 800 C.",2013-08-09,1977-01-01,/api/citations/19780005039/downloads/19780005039.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780005015

Several input forms were used during the tests to investigate the consistency of parameter estimates as it relates to inputs. These consistencies were compared by using the ensemble variance and estimated Cramer-Rao lower bound. In addition, the relationship between inputs and parameter correlations was investigated. Results from the stabilator inputs are inconclusive but the sequence of rudder input followed by aileron input or aileron followed by rudder gave more consistent estimates than did rudder or ailerons individually. Also, square-wave inputs appeared to provide slightly improved consistency in the parameter estimates when compared to sine-wave inputs.",2013-09-03,1977-12-01,/api/citations/19780005128/downloads/19780005128.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

This simple device has one moving part and uses approximately 3% of the air consumed by a pneumatic vibrator on the same job. The principle of operation is very simple: air stored in the unit's reservoir is expelled directly into the material via a patented quick release valve. The number, size, and placement of the blaster units on the storage vessel is determined by a series of tests to ascertain flowability of the problem material. These tests in conjunction with the hopper or silo configuration determine specification of a low pressure pneumatic blasting system.

Within segment field-center, classification accuracies for spring wheat vs. barley tended to be best in mid-July when crop color changes were in progress. When correlations were made for differences in atmospheric haze, data from several segments could be aggregated, and results that approached within segment accuracies were obtained for selected dates. LACIE field measurement spectral reflectance data provided information on both wheat development patterns and the importance of various agronomic factors on wheat reflectance, the most important being availability of soil moisture. To investigate early season detection for winter wheat, reflectance of developing wheat patterns was simulated through reflectance modeling and was analyzed along with field measured reflectance from a Kansas site. The green component development of the wheat field was analyzed as a function of data throughout the season. A selected threshold was not crossed by all fields until mid-April.

The optimum location is found by minimizing the sum of the squares of the perpendicular great-circle distances from the source to the bearing lines. This is achieved analytically through an eigenvalue approach, rather than the usual iterative, numerical approach. Bearings of different weight are taken into account by approximating the distance from each direction finder to the source. The result is general and may have wide application.

This system was then examined as both neat resin and as a matrix resin for carbon fiber composites. The neat resin displayed a significant increase in both fracture toughness and energy release rate values.

It was found that relatively large amounts of Te must be added to the melt to achieve lattice matching because of its low segregation coefficient relative to Se. A significant lattice-pulling effect was discovered for the 5-percent Sn case, and a similar effect is expected for the 10- and 20-percent Sn cases.",2013-08-13,1987-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

In directions typical of extragalactic pointings, the background in the space ultraviolet reaches 26 mag/sq arcsec for the wavelength 2000 A, which is a factor of 40 darker than at any wavelength on the ground. This represents an important new 'window' for the study of extragalactic systems with low surface brightness. Taking into account the UV/V energy distributions of potential targets, it is found that in certain favorable circumstances UV photometry may permit the detection of regions with equivalent V band surface brightness as low as 35 mag/sq arcsec, or over 100,000 times fainter than the ground-based sky.",2013-08-13,1987-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

No hot companions were detected for the MS stars HR 85, 4647, 6702, and 8062, and the S star HR 8714. Limits on the luminosities of possible white dwarf companions provide lower limits of 2-5x10 to the 8th yr to the ages of any degenerate companions. All five stars exhibit strong Tc I lines, and the presence of technetium, with a half-life of 2.1x10 to the 5th yr, signifies recent nucleosynthesis. The limits on the ages of possible white dwarf companions that are equal to or greater than 1000 half-lives of Tc exclude the possibility that the s-process elemental enhancement seen in these MS and S stars resulted from mass transfer from a more highly evolved companion (as is probably the mechanism by which barium stars are created).

The UV continuum flux distributions are generally flatter than systems of low inclination and high mass-transfer rate, and the white dwarfs/inner disk appear to be relatively cool (15,000-19,000 K) for their orbital periods, possibly because the boundary layers are blocked from view. The continuum fluxes increase at spot phases, with the spot providing the dominant flux in IP Peg. The spot temperatures range from hot (20,000 K) in IP Peg, and perhaps in PG 1030+590, to cool (11,000 K) in V1315 Aql.

These models are consistent with eclipse observation by Dunbar and Tedesco (1986) but not with Reinsch and Pakull (1987). The most likely model for Charon is the standard asteroid model, typical for the icy Galilean and Saturnian satellites. Charon models with a significant atmosphere can be ruled out. Based on currently available radius and albedo constraints, no significant numerical distinction is possible between Pluto models ranging from isothermal spheres with surface emissivity between 0.4 and 0.9. Concerns regarding the viability of an emissivity as low as 0.4 favor the higher-emissivity models. The globally uniform surface temperature of Pluto may thus at present be as low as 45 K, with a methane column abundance of 6.7 cm atm. The most likely models are centered on radii of 1180 and 747 km and albedos of 0.47 and 0.26 for Pluto and Charon, respectively.",2013-08-13,1987-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

In addition, the radiation signatures of these waves were examined. It is shown that the wave-particle interactions have a significant effect on the overall distribution of the electrons and that it is unlikely that such effects can be discerned in the observed bremsstrahlung or synchrotron radiation of the nonthermal electrons.

Radial velocity measurements reveal a small (K = 30 km/s) velocity variation modulated at 0.93 d, which appears to be the orbital period. No strong constraints can be put on the mass of the collapsed object, but its companion must be a low-mass, evolved star. Evidence for a precessing disk with a possible period of 69 days is presented. Exosat X-ray observations reveal no short-term (less than 6 hr) periodicities, although erratic, random variations were observed.

19880027223,INSTRUMENTATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY,Power meter for optical efficiency measurements of laser-induced plasmas,A power meter was constructed to measure the power being deposited in transient laser-induced plasmas (LIP). The design rejects the radiation scattered from the laser beam by the LIP and that transmitted past the LIP. The power meter is constructed from a small metal-capped flask placed in an evacuated chamber. The steady-state heat production in the flask is determined from measurements of the temperature gradient on a thermal resistance connecting the top of the flask with a heat sink. The design worked well and should be applicable to a wide variety of situations if the dimensions of the system are adjusted to compensate for power levels substantially different from those used here.,2013-08-13,1987-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

Signals are received into subgroup mixers for blocking into respective frequency ranges. The outputs of these mixers are in turn fed to a master mixer which produces a composite electrical signal. An optical transmitter connected to the master mixer converts the composite signal into an optical signal and transmits it over a fiber optic cable to an optical receiver which receives the signal and converts it back to a composite electrical signal. A de-multiplexer is coupled to the output of the receiver for separating the composite signal back into composite video, digital data, and audio signals. A programmable optic patch board is interposed in the fiber optic cables for selectively connecting the optical signals to various receivers and transmitters.",2013-09-03,1977-12-06,/api/citations/19780006946/downloads/19780006946.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A positive gradient of approximately 350% per AU is found between .3 AU and 1 AU. Between 1 AU and some 3-5 AU, the gradient is variable with an average value of 100% per AU which is consistent with earlier statistical results. A comparison between measurements at 9 AU and approximately 4 AU shows a negative gradient which is variable from -40 to -100% per AU. Possible solar latitudinal effects on these gradient studies are also discussed. Using solar wind and magnetic field data from Helios 1 between 1 AU and .3 AU, the relation between corotating energetic particle events in the inner solar system and the interplanetary medium is examined. It is found that the energetic particles are contained inside the high speed solar wind stream in a region adjacent to the interaction region between low speed and high speed streams.",2013-09-03,1977-12-01,/api/citations/19780007037/downloads/19780007037.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

However, for a given test gas, the range of operating conditions producing useful flow is shown to be rather limited; hence, the facility yields a given flow condition for a given test gas, and variation in flow conditions comes about by using different test gases. Data are presented for operations using air and carbon dioxide as test gases.

The optimum impedance was correlated with cut-off ratio because the cut-off ratio appears to be the fundamental parameter governing the propagation of sound in the duct. Modes with similar cut-off ratios respond in a similar way to the acoustic liner. The correlation is a semi-empirical expression developed from an empirical modification of an equation originally derived from sound propagation theory in a thin boundary layer. This correlating equation represents a part of a simplified liner design method, based upon modal cut-off ratio, for multimodal noise propagation.",2013-09-03,1978-01-01,/api/citations/19780007910/downloads/19780007910.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Plans for ground-based observations, a Spacelab cometary observatory, and the Space Telescope are included in the observational program. The cometary mission sequence begins with a dual-spacecraft flyby of Halley's comet. The nominal mission strategy calls for a simultaneous launch of two spacecraft towards an intercept with Halley in March 1986. After the Halley encounter, the spacecraft are retargeted: one to intercept comet Borrelly in January 1988 and the other to intercept comet Tempel-2 in September 1988. The additional cometary intercepts are accomplished by utilizing a novel Earth-swingby technique. The next mission in the cometary program plan, a rendezvous with Encke's comet, is scheduled for launch in early 1990. It is planned to rendezvous with Encke in September 1992 at a heliocentric distance of 4 AU. Following this near-aphelion rendezvous, the spacecraft will remain with with Encke through the next two perihelion passages in February 1994 and May 1997.

Two mill-processed forms of this alloy were examined. The forged material was essentially processed above the beta transus while the rolled form was subjected to considerable work below the beta transus. Between 1150 and 1250 K, the forged material was stronger and more creep resistant than the rolled alloy. Both forms exhibit superplastic characteristics in this temperature range. Strain measurements during diffusion welding experiments at 1200 K reveal that weld interfaces have no measurable effect on the overall creep deformation.

The effects of centerbody position, entry lip contraction ratio, diffuser length, and diffuser area ratio on inlet total pressure recovery, distortion, and noise suppression were investigated at static conditions and at forward velocity and angle of attack. With the centerbody in the takeoff position (retracted), good aerodynamic and acoustic performance was attained at static conditions and at forward velocity. At 0 deg incidence angle with a sound pressure level reduction of 20 dB, the total pressure recovery was 0.986. Pressure recovery at 50 deg was 0.981. With the centerbody in the approach position (extended), diffuser flow separation occurred at an incidence angle of approximately 20 deg. However, good performance was attained at lower angles. With the centerbody in the takeoff position the ability of the inlet to tolerate high incidence angles was improved by increasing the lip contraction ratio. However, at static conditions with the centerbody in the approach position, an optimum lip contraction ratio appears to exist, with both thinner and thicker lips yielding reduced performance.",2013-09-03,1978-02-01,/api/citations/19780010055/downloads/19780010055.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The influence of several geometrical and flow parameters - rotor/stator spacing, stator solidity and stator incidence angle - were studied to determine the unsteady response of the stator to these parameters. A major influence on the stator unsteady response is due to the stator solidity. At high solidities the blade-to-blade interference has a larger contribution. While the range of rotor/stator spacings investigated had a minor influence, the effect of stator incidence angle is significant.

New sufficient conditions are derived to assign an almost arbitrary set of minimum (n,m + r - 1) distinct eigenvalues where n, m, and r are the number of states, inputs, and outputs, respectively. These conditions precisely identify the class of systems where such an assignment is impossible. The synthesis technique also highlights the freedom in selection of closed-loop eigenvectors under output feedback. The utility of eigenvalue/eigenvector assignment in transient response shaping is illustrated by the design of a controller for the lateral dynamics of an aircraft.",2013-09-03,1978-02-01,/api/citations/19780010880/downloads/19780010880.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Limited subjective tests conducted to examine the human detection and annoyance thresholds for building vibration and rattle caused by aircraft noise showed that both vibration and rattle were detected subjectively in several houses for some operations of both the Concorde and subsonic aircraft. Preliminary results indicate that the relationship between window vibration and aircraft noise is: (1) linear, with vibration levels being accurately predicted from OASPL levels measured near the window; (2) consistent from flyover to flyover for a given aircraft type under approach conditions; (3) no different for Concorde than for other conventional jet transports (in the case of window vibrations induced under approach power conditions); and (4) relatively high levels of window vibration measured during Concorde operations are due more to higher OASPL levels than to unique Concorde source characteristics.",2013-09-03,1978-01-01,/api/citations/19780010930/downloads/19780010930.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Tests of the heat transport capability were greater than or equal to the analytical predictions for the no gas case. When gas was added, the pipe performance degraded by 18% at zero tilt as was expected. The placement of the reservoir heater and the test fixture cooling fins are believed to have caused a superheated vapor condition in the reservoir. Erroneously high reservoir temperature indications resulted from this condition. The observed temperature gradients in the reservoir lend support to this theory. The net result was higher than predicted reservoir temperatures. Also, significant increases in minimum heat load resulted for controller set point temperatures higher than 0 C. At 30 C, control within the tolerance band was maintained, but high reservoir heater power was required. Analyses showed that control is not possible for reasonably low reservoir heater power.

It was found that copper with either chemisorbed oxygen, nitrogen, or sulphur exhibited higher contact strength on stoichiometric SiO2 than did clean copper. Since the surface density of states induced by these species on copper is similar, it appears that the strength of the interfacial bond can be related to the density of states on the metal surface.",2013-09-03,1978-03-24,/api/citations/19780011596/downloads/19780011596.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

19780011632,EARTH RESOURCES AND REMOTE SENSING,Determination of aerosol content in the atmosphere from LANDSAT data,"The author has identified the following significant results. A large set of LANDSAT 2 data, obtained at San Diego, showed excellent linear relationships, particularly for MSS 5 and MSS 6, between the radiance over the ocean and the atmospheric aerosol content. Two other data points obtained at Adrigole, Ireland, representing a different ocean and a different ground truth instrument, showed very good agreement with the San Diego data. It appeared that the technique could be used for global monitoring of the atmospheric aerosol content over the oceans. Results obtained at several inland bodies of water showed that MSS 4, MSS 5, and MSS 6 cannot be used due to the effect of water pollution generally present. However, the LANDSAT 1 results suggested that MSS 7, which operates at longer wavelengths, was not very sensitive to water pollution, and might be useful for inland measurements of aerosol content. Use of the longer wavelength would also minimize the effects of adjacent high albedo land, since atmospheric scattering was reduced at longer wavelengths.",2013-09-03,1978-01-27,/api/citations/19780011632/downloads/19780011632.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The facility was modeled after an existing full size NASA facility which consisted of a coaxial turbofan jet engine with a rectangular nozzle in a blown surface configuration. The flow field of the model facility was examined with and without a simulated wing surface in place at several locations downstream of the nozzle exit plane.

The onset of condensation effects were found to correlate more with the amount of supercooling in the free stream than it did with the supercooling in the region of maximum local Mach number over the airfoil. Effects in the pressure distribution over the airfoil were generally seen to appear over its entire length at nearly the same total temperature. Both observations suggest the possibility of heterogeneous nucleation occurring in the free stream. The potential operational benefits of the supercooling realized are presented in terms of increased Reynolds number capability at a given tunnel total pressure, reduced drive fan power if Reynolds number is held constant, and reduced liquid nitrogen consumption if Reynolds number is again constant. Depending on total pressure and free stream Mach number, these three benefits are found to respectively vary from 7 to 19%, 11 to 25%, and 9 to 20%.",2013-09-03,1978-03-01,/api/citations/19780012131/downloads/19780012131.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A cyclic procedure has been developed for representation of adjacent blade-to-blade passages which asymptotically achieves the correct phase between all passages of a stage. A shock-capturing finite difference method is employed in the interior of the passage, and a method of characteristics technique is used at the boundaries. The blade slipstreams form two of the passage boundaries and are treated as moving contact surfaces capable of supporting jumps in entropy and tangential velocity. The Kutta condition is imposed by requiring the slipstreams to originate at the trailing edges, which are assumed to be sharp. Results are presented for several transonic fan rotors and compared with available experimental data, consisting of holographic observations of shock structure and pressure contour maps. A subcritical stator solution is also compared with results from a relaxation method. Finally, a periodic solution for a stage consisting of 44 rotor blades and 46 stator blades is discussed.",2013-09-03,1977-12-01,/api/citations/19780012139/downloads/19780012139.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Otherwise, instrumentation was standard. Such factors as the selection of video parameters, the pilot's understanding of the television presentation, the pilot's ground cockpit environment, and the operational procedures for landing were considered. About 30 landings were necessary for a pilot to become sufficiently familiar and competent with the test aircraft to make powered approaches and landings with outside visual references only through television.

One method was used as published; the other was modified for certain cases of coolant discharge from the blade suction surface. For coolant ejection from blade surface regions where the surface static pressures are higher than the blade exit pressure, both methods predict the experimental results quite well. However, for ejection from regions with surface static pressures lower than the blade exit pressure, both methods predict too small a change in efficiency.

The method was needed for the Voyager spacecraft mission requirement which limited the uncertainty in the knowledge of lateral center of mass of the spacecraft system weighing 750 kg to be less than 1.0 mm (0.04 in.). The method consists of using three load cells symmetrically located at 120 deg apart on a turntable with respect to the vertical axis of the spacecraft and making six measurements for each load cell. These six measurements are taken by cyclic rotations of the load cell turntable and of the spacecraft, about the vertical axis of the measurement fixture. This method eliminates all alignment, leveling, and load cell calibration errors for the lateral center of mass determination, and permits a statistical best fit of the measurement data. An associated data reduction computer program called MASCM has been written to implement this method and has been used for the Voyager spacecraft.",2013-09-03,1978-04-15,/api/citations/19780012234/downloads/19780012234.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

Individual events within the flash also have characteristic RF patterns.

Fourier spectrum, Fourier transfer function, shock spectrum and shock spectrum ratio were examined in the frequency domain analysis and pulse shape deconvolution was developed for use in the time domain analysis. Comparisons of the relative performance of each analysis technique are made for the characterization of acoustic emission pulses recorded by a measuring system. To demonstrate the relative sensitivity of each of the methods to small changes in the pulse shape, signatures of computer modeled systems with analytical pulses are presented. Optimization techniques are developed and used to indicate the best design parameter values for deconvolution of the pulse shape. Several experiments are presented that test the pulse signature analysis methods on different acoustic emission sources. These include acoustic emission associated with (a) crack propagation, (b) ball dropping on a plate, (c) spark discharge, and (d) defective and good ball bearings.

The range of advancing tip Mach numbers were between 0.72 to 0.96, and the advance ratios were from 0.2 to 0.375. At low and moderate advancing tip Mach number, the data in the dbA scale appear to indicate the swept tip is the quietest, swept tapered the second, tapered third and rectangular the most noisy. Above an advancing tip Mach number of about 0.89, a distinct acoustical pulse can be observed, which dominates the acoustical waveform. The pulse shape is symmetric at moderate tip Mach number, changing to a sawtooth shape at high advancing tip Mach numbers.

Transverse profiles of the absolute integrated intensity were measured with the optically thin CsI lines (0.5664 and 0.5636 microns) at a range of axial positions downstream of the 5-cm-diameter combustor nozzle exit. Radial profiles of the emission coefficient were obtained from the measured transverse profiles of intensity by Abel inversion.

The observational consequences of this debris determined by moderate spectral resolution infrared spectrophotometry are reviewed.

Determination of the average throat Mach number used to compare high Mach inlet noise reduction characteristics was based on a correlation of inlet wall static pressure measurements with a flow field calculation. The largest noise reductions were generally obtained with the higher tip speed fan. At a throat Mach number of 0.79, the difference in noise reduction was about 3.5 db with static test conditions. Although the noise reduction increased for the lower tip speed fan with a simulated flight velocity of 41 m/sec (80 knots), it was still about 2 db less than that of the high tip speed fan which was only tested at the static condition. However, variations in acoustic performance could not be absolutely attributed to the different fan designs because of differences in inlet lip contours which resulted in small variations of peak wall Mach number and axial extend of supersonic and near-sonic flow.",2013-09-03,1978-01-01,/api/citations/19780013165/downloads/19780013165.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A concurrent investigation was conducted on Kevlar-49/epoxy coupons exposed to an outdoor environment over a three year period at various locations providing a variety of climatic conditions. Weight changes and retention of mechanical properties were determined after one and three years exposure. A net weight loss occurred due to ultraviolet effects on the unpainted specimens.

A computer program is developed to solve the time-dependent equations, and is applied to explain aspects of closed vessel behavior. In the case of nitramine propellants the cratering of the burning surface associated with combustion above break-point pressures augments the effective burning rate as deduced from the closed vessel experiment. Low pressure combustion is significantly affected by the ignition process and, in the case of nitramine propellants, by the developing and changing surface structure. Thus, burning rates deduced from the closed vessel experiment may or may not agree with those measured in the equilibrium strand burner. Series of T burner experiments are performed to compare the combustion instability characteristics of nitramine (HMX) containing propellants and ammonium perchlorate (AP)propellants. Although ash produced by more fuel rich propellants could have provided mechanical suppression, results from clean-burning propellants permit the conclusion that HMX reduces the acoustic driving.",2013-09-03,1977-11-01,/api/citations/19780014299/downloads/19780014299.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

To realize a particular commanded torque, the gimbal rates of the CMG must be specified. These gimbal rates are shown to be functions of gimbal angle orientation and the commanded torque. The conventional cross-product steering law was derived by minimizing a function which was the square of the magnitude of the error between the commanded torque and the realizable torque of the gyro. This steering law was severely dependent upon the inner gimbal angle. When the inner gimbal reaches 90 degrees, the cross product law requires infinite outer gimbal rates to realize finite torque values.",2013-08-09,1978-01-01,,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,19780015067

Guidance problems such as capturing an ILS beam at a specified point on the beam, intercepting a VOR radial, and point-to-point navigation can be formulated in terms of these problems.

A common mechanism which scales with planetary radius is suggested. Martian canyons are significantly wider than African rifts. The overall pattern of the rift systems of Africa and Mars are quite different in that the African systems are composed of numerous small faults with highly variable trend. On Mars the trends are less variable; individual scarps are straighter for longer than on earth. This is probably due to the difference in tectonic histories of the two planets: the complex history of the earth and the resulting complicated basement structures influence the development of new rifts. The basement and lithosphere of Mars are inferred to be simple, reflecting a relatively inactive tectonic history prior to the formation of the canyonlands.",2013-09-03,1978-05-01,/api/citations/19780016081/downloads/19780016081.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,
19780016088,SPACE RADIATION,Variations in the spatial distribution of 11 Micron radiation from omicron Ceti,The spatial distribution of 11 micron radiation from omicron Ceti was observed at various phases of its light cycle using a stellar interferometer. Changes were seen which can be attributed to variation in the strength of thermal emission from circumstellar dust relative to the stellar continuum at 11 microns. These changes are shown to be correlated with the changes in luminosity of micron Ceti in such a way that dust grain emission at 11 microns was increased more than the continuum during the period of maximum luminosity. The degree of the change in dust grain emission implies that the maximum dust temperature is in the range of 500 K to 700 K during minimum stellar luminosity.,2013-09-03,1977-01-01,/api/citations/19780016088/downloads/19780016088.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

These measurements were used to develop spanwise distributions for the momentum strength and location of the engine exhaust stream tube with the results used as input parameters to one jet flap analytical method. It is shown that a comparison of the momentum coefficients obtained from forward speed wake surveys with the predicted values from static force data results in a good correlation, which verifies the use of the flap thrust recovery factor as a means of predicting the momentum strength at the flap trailing edge. Also, when wake survey distributions of momentum strength and direction are used as input parameters to one analytical jet flap method, the results show reasonable agreement between the experimental data and analytical results.",2013-08-09,1976-01-01,/api/citations/19780016111/downloads/19780016111.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The model used blowing slots across the span of the wing to produce a thin jet efflux near the leading edge and at the knee of the trailing edge flap (internally blown jet flap). Results indicate that these concepts have both good propulsive related lift and low drag due to lift characteristics because of uniform spanwise propulsive thrust. The leading edge blowing concept provides low speed lift characteristics which are competitive with the flap-hinge-line blowing concept and does not require additional leading edge treatment for prevention of abrupt stall.,2013-08-09,1976-01-01,/api/citations/19780016113/downloads/19780016113.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

A geometrical beaming model is developed in which a single distributed source is located above the darkside auroral region and emits in the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser process. The model can account for nearly all the Uranian kilometric radiation from the high-frequency limit near 850 kHz down to about 150 kHz and for much of it down to the lower limit of 20 kHz.,2013-08-13,1987-12-30,,CDMS,OTHER,
19880039602,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Models of Uranium continuum radio emission,"Uranium continuum radio emission detected by the Voyager 2 Planetary Radio Astronomy experiment during the January 1986 encounter is considered. The continuum emissions comprised four components (equatorial emissions, anomaly emissions, strong nightside emissions, and weak nightside emissions) associated with different sources. The equatorial emissions appeared most prominently during the days before closest approach and extended from 40 kHz or below to about 120 kHz. The anomaly emissions were seen about 12 hours before closest approach and extended to about 250 kHz. The agreement found between Miranda's phase and strong radio emission at 20.4 kHz, just after closest approach, suggests intense dynamic activity on the Miranda L shell.",2013-08-13,1987-12-30,,CDMS,OTHER,
19880039605,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Ordinary mode radio emission from Uranus,"On Jan. 24, 1986, during the inbound trajectory to Uranus, the planetary radio astronomy instrument on Voyager 2 detected left-hand-polarized emission for several hours at frequencies near 200 kHz. Unlike the dominant source observed on the nightside of the planet, only a single episode of this inbound emission was seen, and the emission was extremely weak. Generating less than 500 kW, it is probably the weakest freely propagating planetary radio emission thus far observed by Voyager. This weak emission is associated with a source region in the vicinity of the north (dayside) magnetic pole of Uranus, where magnetic-field lines point approximately in the direction of the spacecraft when the emission is observed. Therefore the wave normal angle relative to B is probably less than 90 deg in the generation region. It is concluded that direct wave generation in the magnetoionic ordinary mode is most likely. The source location for this emission is consistent with a region magnetically conjugate to the dominant nightside source, which is located in the vicinity of the south magnetic pole. The ordinary mode emission is discussed in the context of the electron-cyclotron maser mechanism.",2013-08-13,1987-12-30,,CDMS,OTHER,

This paper estimates the heavy ion density that would be consistent with a heavy neutral torus formed by photosputtering, charged particle sputtering, and micrometeoroid impact vaporization of icy surfaces on the moons, taking into account the large 60 deg angle between the satellite orbit plane and the magnetic equator. The expected heavy ion density is unobservably small. The observed proton plasma of the inner magnetosphere can be maintained by ionization of the atomic hydrogen corona and by the ionospheric proton source driven by photoelectron escape, for a plasma residence time of about 30 days. These two proton sources are comparable near L = 5. The same 30-day residence time for energetic protons implies an upper limit of 0.00001 on the fraction of incident solar wind protons that enter the magnetosphere and penetrate to within L less than 6 while conserving their first adiabatic invariants.",2013-08-13,1987-12-30,,CDMS,OTHER,

Direct sampling of the surrounding environment of deep convective clouds shows marked changes in the vertical distribution of the lower and midtroposphere concentration of O3 and such surface-derived species as CO, CO2, and NO. Thermodynamic observations, together with two-dimensional cloud model simulations, confirm vertical transports within the convection and provide a basis for an estimation of the magnitude and efficiency of cloud upward and downward exchanges. A distinction is drawn between local changes due to convective updrafts and downdrafts and convective overturning as a net result of the storm processes.

The results have been analyzed in terms of a theoretical model which assumes an axial composition profile characteristic of diffusion controlled solute redistribution during growth. A comparison of the calculated and measured values suggests a reduction in the applied (empty furnace) temperature gradient by about a factor of three. Values of the interface segregation coefficient (k) determined from the phase diagram, predict values of solute concentration build up in the solid during growth interruptions which are inconsistent with measured results.

The observed modes are not confined to mode rational surfaces, but instead have broad radial extent. A theory assuming ballooning mode spatial structure predicts that a minimum current should be required for linear instability, and that, when the mode is unstable, the linear growth rate scales linearly with the resistivity eta below a critical resistivity, and scales as cu root of eta for larger resistivities. Both predictions are borne out by simulation results. Both theory and simulation analyses of the mode suggest that the strong radial structure of the mode near the ends of the system is the primary contributing factor to the instability of the mode. A helical current sheet is formed in the nonlinear evolution of the mode near the edge of the current channel and is accompanied by a strong radial gradient in the current and partial current reversal.",2013-08-13,1988-02-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

This beam drives electrostatic plasma wave turbulence, which leads to the collective emission of electromagnetic waves. The emitted waves are beamed in the direction of the jet axis, so that end-on viewing of the jet yields an extremely bright source (BL Lacertae object). The relativistic electron beam may also drive long-wavelength electromagnetic plasma instabilities (firehose and Kelvin-Helmholtz) that jumble the jet magnetic field lines. After a sufficient distance from the core source, these instabilities will cause the beamed emission to point in random directions and the jet emission can then be observed from any direction relative to the jet axis. This combination of effects may lead to the gap turn-on of astrophysical jets.

Several changes recorded in TL characteristics, such as the lowering of TL sensitivity in certain samples, its increase in other samples, and changes in the peak position and peak width of TL suggested the occurrence of metamorphic processes in these samples. It is suggested that, for the chondrite types above 3.2, the observed changes in TL are consistent with the TL-metamorphism trends, being due to the formation of feldspar by the devitrification of chondrule glass during metamorphism.

The technique utilizes room-temperature codeposition of Co and Si in stoichiometric ratio, followed by the deposition of an amorphous Si capping layer and subsequent in situ annealing at 550-600 C. CoSi2 films grown without the Si cap are found to have pinhole densities of (1-10) x 10 to the 7th/sq cm when annealed at similar temperatures.

To minimize latitudinal ambiguity, the plasma-sheet boundary layer observed with ISEE 2 and the discrete aurora at the poleward edge of the auroral oval with DE 1 are studied. The overall current observed at highest latitudes is flowing into the ionosphere, and is likely to be carried by ionospheric electrons flowing upward. There are, however, smaller-scale current structures within this region. The sense and magnitude of the field-aligned currents agree at the two sites. The ISEE 2 data suggests that the high-latitude downward current corresponds to the high-latitude boundary of the plasma-sheet boundary layer, and may be associated with the ion beams observed there.",2013-08-13,1988-03-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The results of the static acoustic tests show a very beneficial interaction effect. When the measured noise levels were compared with the predicted noise levels of two independent but equivalent conical nozzle flow streams, noise reductions for the unsuppressed coannular nozzles were of the order of 10 PNdB; high levels of suppression (8 PNdB) were still maintained even when only a small amount of core stream flow was used. The multielement fan suppressed coannular nozzle tests showed 15 PNdB noise reductions and up to 18 PNdB noise reductions when a treated ejector was added. The static aerodynamic performance tests showed that the unsuppressed coannular plug nozzles obtained gross thrust coefficients of 0.972, with 1.2 to 1.7 percent lower levels for the multielement fan-suppressed coannular flow nozzles. For the first time anywhere, laser velocimeter velocity profile measurements were made on these types of nozzle configurations and with supersonic heated flow conditions.

Both high-pressure air and solid circular cylinders with the cylinder diameter equal to the nozzle-exit diameter were used to simulate jet exhausts. The results indicate that boundary-layer separation is most extensive on steep boattails at high Mach numbers. The jet total-pressure ratio changes (jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure) affected the extent of separation very little; however, comparison of the separation data obtained by using the two jet-simulation techniques indicate that entrainment associated with the presence of a jet had a significant effect on the extent of separation.

19780022129,AIRCRAFT COMMUNICATIONS AND NAVIGATION,Characteristics of constrained optimum trajectories with specified range,"Necessary conditions of optimality are derived for trajectories whose structure is limited to climb, steady cruise, and descent segments. The performance function consists of the sum of fuel and time costs, referred to as direct operating cost (DOC). The state variable is range to go and the independent variable is energy. In this formulation a cruise segment always occurs at the optimum cruise energy for sufficiently large range. At short ranges (500 n. mi. and less) a cruise segment may also occur below the optimum cruise energy. The existence of such a cruise segment depends primarily on the fuel flow vs thrust characteristics and on thrust constraints. If thrust is a free control variable along with airspeed, it is shown that such cruise segments will not generally occur. If thrust is constrained to some maximum value in climb and to some minimum in descent, such cruise segments generally will occur. Computer calculations of typical short-range trajectories obtained about a 1% cost penalty for constraining the thrust.",2013-09-03,1978-09-01,/api/citations/19780022129/downloads/19780022129.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The microstructure of all heat-treated test coupons was studied both optically and by transmission electron microscopy. Fracture surfaces were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate that substantial improvement in toughness with no loss in strength can be accomplished in quenched and tempered steel by austenitizing at 1255 K or higher. Low fracture toughness in conventionally austenitized 300M steel (1144 K) appears to be caused by undissolved precipitates, seen both in the submicrostructure and on the fracture surface, which promote failure by quasi-cleavage.

Work is done to further understand the nature and origin of the fluctuations and their connection with fluctuation-induced transport. The approach is to monitor the density and potential fluctuations; to digitize the data; and to generate, with the aid of a computer, various spectral properties by means of the fast fourier transform. Of particular interest is the computer-generated transport spectrum that indicates in a quantitative way which fluctuation spectral components contribute to transport and which do not. All experimental measurements of the spectral characteristics of the plasma are given in absolute units rather than as relative values.

19780023088,SOLAR PHYSICS,Reverse Current in Solar Flares,"An idealized steady state model of a stream of energetic electrons neutralized by a reverse current in the pre-flare solar plasma was developed. These calculations indicate that, in some cases, a significant fraction of the beam energy may be dissipated by the reverse current. Joule heating by the reverse current is a more effective mechanism for heating the plasma than collisional losses from the energetic electrons because the Ohmic losses are caused by thermal electrons in the reverse current which have much shorter mean free paths than the energetic electrons. The heating due to reverse currents is calculated for two injected energetic electron fluxes. For the smaller injected flux, the temperature of the coronal plasma is raised by about a factor of two. The larger flux causes the reverse current drift velocity to exceed the critical velocity for the onset of ion cyclotron turbulence, producing anomalous resistivity and an order of magnitude increase in the temperature. The heating is so rapid that the lack of ionization equilibrium may produce a soft X-ray and EUV pulse from the corona.",2013-09-03,1978-08-01,/api/citations/19780023088/downloads/19780023088.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

The available filter materials which transmit radiation longward of 400 A are also highly transparent at wavelengths shortward of 100 A. Conventional EUV optics, with grazing engles of less than about 10 deg, have very high throughput in the EUV, which persists to wavelengths shortward of 100 A. Use of such optics with the longer-wavelength EUV filters thus results in an unacceptably large soft X-ray leak. This problem is overcome by developing a mirror design with larger graze angles of not less than 20 deg, which has high throughput at wavelengths longer than 400 A but at the same time very little throughput shortward of 100 A.",2013-08-13,1988-04-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

19880048341,NONMETALLIC MATERIALS,Investigation of PTFE transfer films by infrared emission spectroscopy and phase-locked ellipsometry,"When a PTFE sheet was rubbed unidirectionally over a smooth surface of stainless steel an essentially monomolecular transfer film was formed. by ellipsometric and emission infrared spectroscopic techniques it was shown that the film was 10 to 15 A thick and birefringent. From the intensity differences of infrared bands obtained with a polarizer passing radiation polarized in mutually perpendicular planes, it was possible to deduce transfer film orientation with the direction of rubbing. After standing in air for several weeks the transfer films apparently increased in thickness by as much as threefold. At the same time both the index of refraction and the absorption index decreased. Examination of the surfaces by optical and electron microscopies showed that the films had become porous and flaky. These observations were consistent with previous tribological measurements. The coefficients of friction decreased with the formation of the transfer film but increased again as the film developed breaks. The applicability of the ellipsometric and polarized infrared emission techniques to the identification of monomolecular tribological transfer films of polymers such as PTFE has been demonstrated.",2013-08-13,1988-04-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The observational data are summarized in a table and compared with the results of numerical simulations of the accretion of wind/flare material onto the white dwarf. The rotational modulation model is found to reproduce the observed line features only if the magnetic field is strong (about 10 kG), the accretion rate is about 10 to the -15th solar mass/yr, and the polar cap area is much larger than the theoretical lower limit of 5.7 x 10 to the 14th sq cm.

The orbital period of the binary is found to be 1181.1 days, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.188. A new ephemeris is given, which accurately predicts the times of light maximum and is consistent with the spectroscopic orbit.

It was found that the ratios vary greatly with altitude. At high altitudes in the absence of photoelectron transport, the O(+) and N2(+) ionization rate ratios are about 0.35, but they increase with increasing optical depth; in the vicinity of the ionization peak, the photoelectron rate can exceed the EUV ionization rate for O(+) and N2(+).

When the same solar wind reached Voyager 2 (which moved from 15.2 to 16.1 AU during the corresponding time interval, September 27, 1984, to January 27, 1985), the enhancements in the magnetic field strength and the plasma density and temperature recurred with a period of approximately 25 days. Thus the period of the large-scale fluctuations in B, N, and T doubled between 1 AU and 15.2 AU. The magnetic field strength increased linearly with the density and the temperature in the Voyager 2 data.

The results confirm the earlier estimates that the ionospheric Pedersen conductance of Saturn's ionosphere ranges from 0.3 to 17 mho near the terminator as a function of latitude. The source of discrepancy appears to be the inclusion by Eviatar and Richardson of ion density into the ion-neutral collision frequency term, which is incorrect.

The instability is generated by the perpendicular component of free energy in the ions, which can arise either via a temperature anisotropy or via a gyrating distribution. In the former case, the generation of whistler waves is confined to a fairly narrow cone of propagation directions centered about parallel propagation; in the latter case, the maximum growth of the instability can occur at fairly large obliquities (theta equal to about 50 deg).",2013-08-13,1988-05-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

In this protocol, each file is divided into packets, which are error-detected and acknowledge individually. A file can be transferred in either the open- or closed-end connection. In the open-end connection, the file is transmitted continuously according to the selective-repeat scheme until all packets are positively acknowledged; in the closed-end connection, each retransmission will initiate its own connection request. The relationship between the packet size and the average end-to-end delay in the mobile fading environment is investigated. The communications channel uses trellis-coded modulation with symbol interleaving, packet replication, and error detection. The packet error performance in such a channel is evaluated by simulation, and the optimal packet size for various operating conditions is derived, using the simulated results. It is shown that for a symbol-energy-to-noise ratio of 12 dB, each file should be divided into packets of length between 256 bits and 512 bits (excluding the overhead) to minimize the average end-to-end delay.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

However, it was discovered that the performance of a strain-gage balance is not affected when subjected to the magnetic environment of the MSBS. The use of strain-gage balances greatly reduces the effort required to perform a current-vs.-load calibration as external loads can be directly inferred from the balance outputs while a calibrator is suspended in MSBS. It is conceivable that in the future such a calibration could become unnecessary, since an even more important application for the use of a strain-gage balance in MSBS environment is the acquisition of precision aerodynamic force and moment data by telemetering the balance outputs from a suspended model/core/balance during wind tunnel tests.",2013-08-13,1987-01-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The flaring emission probably originates in different regions at the two wavelengths. Radio flares from RS CVn stars may originate in sources that are larger than, or comparable to, a star in size.

These results are combined with those derived for the 2175 A bump in a previous study. It is found that IUE extinction curves can be represented by linear combinations of a Lorentzian-like 2175 A bump profile, a well-determined FUV curvature term, and an underlying linear component. The parameters of the linear component are strongly correlated and therefore only five free parameters are required to fit all of the curves in our sample. Three parameters describe the 2175 A bump, one parameter describes the linear background, and one parameter describes the strength of the FUV curvature term. The shape of the FUV curvature is found to be identical, to within the observational errors, for all the curves in the sample - which spans virtually the entire range of extinction curve morphologies observed in the Milky Way.",2013-08-13,1988-05-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

The filament motion begins several minutes before the impulsive or flash phase of the flare. No new accleration is observed in the motion of the filament during the onset of the impulsive phase for at least two of the four flares. The most common H-alpha brightenings associated with the impulsive phase lie near the magnetic inversion line roughly centered under the erupting filament. Filament speeds at the onset of the impulsive or flash phase lie in the range 30-180 km/s. These characteristics indicate that the filament eruption is not driven by the flare plasma pressure, but instead marks an eruption of magnetic field driven by a global MHD instability of the field configuration in the region of the flare.",2013-08-13,1988-05-15,,CDMS,OTHER,

19780026469,LUNAR AND PLANETARY EXPLORATION,Photochemistry of the Martian atmosphere,"A critical analysis is carried out for models which may be fine tuned to give agreement with observational constraints for O2, CO, and O3 in the Martian lower atmosphere and which are in accord also with upper atmospheric data for O and CO. The models have a number of features in common: dynamic mixing must be exceedingly rapid at heights above 90 km; if heterogeneous processes are not assumed to play a major role in the removal of atmospheric CO and O2, mixing must be rapid at heights between 30 and 40 km. The value implied for the diffusion coefficient in this region depends on the assumptions made regarding the rates for reaction of OH with HO2 to form H2O and the rate of reaction of HO2 with itself to form H2O2. If these reaction rates are taken to have values similar to those used in current models of the earth's stratosphere, the eddy diffusion coefficient at 40 km above the Martian surface should be about 5 by 10 to the seventh power sq cm/sec.",2013-08-09,1977-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The Al-26 contents of the meteorites with He-3 losses were found to be indistinguishable from the Al-26 contents of L- and H-chondrites. It is concluded that if the He-3 outgassing occurred near the sun, the flux of particles producing Al-26 must have been nearly normal, or the diffusion process must have taken place very rapidly.",2013-08-09,1977-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,
19780026602,ASTROPHYSICS,Structure of radio sources with remarkably flat spectra - PKS 0735+178,"Three incoherent synchrotron models are used to account for the very flat radio spectrum of the BL Lac object PKS 0735+178. The first interpretation is that the spectrum results from optically-thin synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons with a particular energy distribution. The second posits a single nonuniform, self-absorbed source generated by a wind flowing from a central object. The third suggests that sources with flat spectra are caused by the presence of multiple (three or more) discrete uniform components, and that the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution for each source is correlated with the size of the individual components. It is proposed that the last model is the most tenable explanation of the phenomenon, and multi-frequency VLBI observations are suggested for the evaluation of the detailed structure of compact radio sources.",2013-08-09,1977-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

As expected, the pulsars showed ISS, but scintillation was not detected in any other source. A typical upper limit to the rms modulation due to ISS is 150 mJy, giving lower limits to the apparent angular diameter of about 10 to the -6th arcsec. The possibilities that a true point source is broadened to an apparent angular diameter greater than or roughly equal to 10 to the -6th arcsec by scattering local to the source or in a general intergalactic medium are discussed.",2013-08-09,1977-10-01,,CDMS,OTHER,

The application of this method to these equations leads to coupled sets of simultaneous ordinary differential equations whose solutions are obtained along sets of lines in a discretized region. Using the obtained displacement field, normal stresses, and the stress-intensity factor variation along the crack periphery are calculated for different crack depth to bar thickness ratios. Crack opening displacements and stress-intensity factors are also obtained for a through-thickness, center-cracked bar with variable thickness.

The measurements were made with detectors on the OGO-5 and OSO-6 satellites. Spectra for five of the six bursts have been determined using measurements from both satellites in order to reduce ambiguities due to uncertain source locations. A significant fraction, about 20-60%, of the energy of the bursts falls in the hard X-ray range (20-130 keV). The time-integrated spectra have been fitted by power-law, exponential, and thermal-bremsstrahlung functions. They are consistent with power laws which steepen at energies of at least 150 keV, as reported earlier for two other bursts. Evidence for spectral variability from event to event in the hard X-ray region is presented. For a power-law representation, the power-law index has values ranging from approximately unity to 2.5.

In addition, since gamma-rays in the energy range from several MeV to at least 10 to the 12th power eV and neutrinos both have very low interaction cross sections, they have a very high penetrating power and reach the earth from almost any part of the galaxy or universe. Therefore, they retain the detailed imprint of spectral, directional and temporal features imposed at their birth, even if they were born in regions opaque to visible light and X-rays.",2013-09-03,1978-09-01,/api/citations/19780025005/downloads/19780025005.pdf,CDMS,GOV_PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED,

This two slope power law model is shown to have a break (defined as the wavenumber of the change of slope) that increases with decreasing distance from the Sun.
